"""
We're excited for the community to extend and build on the st.experimental_connection interface and make it easier than ever to build Streamlit apps
with a wide variety of data sources. We've built the interface with this in mind. To use a community-built connection in your Streamlit app,
you just need to install and import it, then pass the class to st.experimental_connection(), like this:

```python
import streamlit as st
from st_gsheets_connection import GSheetsConnection

conn = st.experimental_connection("pets_gsheet", type=GSheetsConnection)
pet_owners = conn.read(worksheet="Pet Owners")
st.dataframe(pet_owners)
```

These type of connections work exactly the same as the ones built into Streamlit and have access to all the same capabilities.
