We're very excited to release `st.experimental_connection()`, which makes it easy to connect your Streamlit apps to data and APIs with a fraction of the code.

With st.experimental_connection, connecting to a SQL database becomes just 4 lines of code:

### What's included

st.experimental_connection includes:

- `st.experimental_connection()` factory method to initialize ready-to-use data connection objects
- Concrete implementations built into Streamlit for SQL and Snowpark
- Easy to install connections for [cloud file storage](https://github.com/streamlit/files-connection) and [Google Sheets](https://github.com/streamlit/gsheets-connection)
- An extendable `BaseConnection` class to easily build (and share) new connection types!

üëà Pick a data source to see how easy it is!
