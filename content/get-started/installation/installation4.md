# Install Streamlit

There are multiple ways to set up your development environment and install Streamlit. Read below to
understand these options. Developing locally with Python installed on your own computer is the most
common scenario.

## Summary for experts

1. Set up your Python development environment.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit
   ```
3. Validate the installation by running our Hello app:
   ```bash
   streamlit hello
   ```
4. Jump to our [Basic concepts](/get-started/fundamentals/main-concepts).

## Get a taste without installing

Try a version of Streamlit that runs right in your browser. No install required. Note that this is
not how Streamlit is meant to be used, as it comes with many downsides. That's why it's a
_playground_! Just click the button below and start playing with code in seconds.

## Install on your machine

### Command-line instructions

If you're comfortable with the command line, you can install Streamlit on your own machine using
tools like `pip` and `uv`.

### Anaconda Distribution graphical interface

For those among us who like a nice graphical interface,
a great path is to install Streamlit using the Anaconda Distribution graphical user interface.
**This is also the best approach if you're on Windows and
don't have Python set up yet.**

## Develop on the cloud

### GitHub Codespaces

I want a preconfigured, cloud-based container and editor.

Use Streamlit Community Cloud with GitHub Codespaces so you don't have to go through the trouble of
installing Python and setting up an environment.
