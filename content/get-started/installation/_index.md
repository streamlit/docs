# Install Streamlit

There are multiple ways to set up your development environment and install Streamlit.
Developing locally with Python installed on your own computer is the most
common scenario.

<Tip>

Try a Streamlit Playground that runs in your browser &mdash; no installation required.
(Note that this is not how Streamlit is meant to be used, because it has many downsides. That's why it's a
_playground_!)

## Install Streamlit on your machine

### Option 1: I like the command line

Install Streamlit on your own machine using tools like `venv` and `pip`.

    cssModuleClassName="Orange"
    cssModuleIconClassName="IconRight"
/>

### Option 2: I prefer a graphical interface

Install Streamlit using the Anaconda Distribution graphical user interface. This is also the best
approach if you're on Windows or don't have Python set up.

    cssModuleClassName="Orange"
    cssModuleIconClassName="IconRight"
/>

## Create an app in the cloud

### Option 1: I want a free cloud environment

Use Streamlit Community Cloud with GitHub Codespaces so you don't have to go through the trouble
of installing Python and setting up an environment.

<IconLink
    link="/get-started/installation/community-cloud"
    icon="arrow_forward"
    label="Instructions for GitHub Codespaces"
    cssModuleClassName="Orange"
    cssModuleIconClassName="IconRight"
/>

### Option 2: I need something secure, controlled, and in the cloud

Use Streamlit in Snowflake to code your apps in the cloud, right alongside your
data with role-based access controls.

<IconLink

    icon="arrow_forward"
    label="Instructions for Snowflake"
    cssModuleClassName="Orange"
    cssModuleIconClassName="IconRight"
