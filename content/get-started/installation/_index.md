# Install Streamlit

There are multiple ways to set up your development environment and install Streamlit.
Developing locally with Python installed on your own computer is the most
common scenario.

## Summary for experienced Python developers

1. To set up your Python environment and test your installation, execute the following terminal commands:

   ```bash
   pip install streamlit
   streamlit hello
   ```

<h5>Take me to the playground!</h5>

Try a version of Streamlit that runs right in your browser. No installation required.
(This is not how Streamlit is meant to be used, because it comes with many downsides&mdash;that's why it's a
_playground_!)
