# Basic concepts of Streamlit

Working with Streamlit is simple. First you sprinkle a few Streamlit commands
into a normal Python script, then you run it with `streamlit run`:

```bash
streamlit run your_script.py [-- script args]
```

As soon as you run the script as shown above, a local Streamlit server will
spin up and your app will open in a new tab in your default web browser. The app
is your canvas, where you'll draw charts, text, widgets, tables, and more.

What gets drawn in the app is up to you. For example
[`st.text`](/develop/api-reference/text/st.text) writes raw text to your app, and
[`st.line_chart`](/develop/api-reference/charts/st.line_chart) draws â€” you guessed it â€” a
line chart. Refer to our [API documentation](/develop/api-reference) to see all commands that
are available to you.

<Note>

When passing your script some custom arguments, they must be passed after two dashes. Otherwise the
arguments get interpreted as arguments to Streamlit itself.

</Note>

Another way of running Streamlit is to run it as a Python module. This can be
useful when configuring an IDE like PyCharm to work with Streamlit:

```bash
# Running
python -m streamlit run your_script.py

# is equivalent to:
streamlit run your_script.py
```

<Tip>

You can also pass a URL to `streamlit run`! This is great when combined with
GitHub Gists. For example:

```bash
streamlit run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streamlit/demo-uber-nyc-pickups/master/streamlit_app.py
```

</Tip>

## Development flow

Every time you want to update your app, save the source file. When you do
that, Streamlit detects if there is a change and asks you whether you want to
rerun your app. Choose "Always rerun" at the top-right of your screen to
automatically update your app every time you change its source code.

This allows you to work in a fast interactive loop: you type some code, save
it, try it out live, then type some more code, save it, try it out, and so on
until you're happy with the results. This tight loop between coding and viewing
results live is one of the ways Streamlit makes your life easier.

<Tip>

While developing a Streamlit app, it's recommended to lay out your editor and
browser windows side by side, so the code and the app can be seen at the same
time. Give it a try!

</Tip>

As of Streamlit version 1.10.0 and higher, Streamlit apps cannot be run from the root directory of Linux distributions. If you try to run a Streamlit app from the root directory, Streamlit will throw a `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory` error. For more information, see GitHub issue [#5239](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/5239).

If you are using Streamlit version 1.10.0 or higher, your main script should live in a directory other than the root directory. When using Docker, you can use the `WORKDIR` command to specify the directory where your main script lives. For an example of how to do this, read [Create a Dockerfile](/deploy/tutorials/docker#create-a-dockerfile).

## Data flow

Streamlit's architecture allows you to write apps the same way you write plain
Python scripts. To unlock this, Streamlit apps have a unique data flow: any
time something must be updated on the screen, Streamlit reruns your entire
Python script from top to bottom.

This can happen in two situations:

- Whenever you modify your app's source code.

- Whenever a user interacts with widgets in the app. For example, when dragging
  a slider, entering text in an input box, or clicking a button.

Whenever a callback is passed to a widget via the `on_change` (or `on_click`) parameter, the callback will always run before the rest of your script. For details on the Callbacks API, please refer to our [Session State API Reference Guide](/develop/api-reference/caching-and-state/st.session_state#use-callbacks-to-update-session-state).

And to make all of this fast and seamless, Streamlit does some heavy lifting
for you behind the scenes. A big player in this story is the
[`@st.cache_data`](#caching) decorator, which allows developers to skip certain
costly computations when their apps rerun. We'll cover caching later in this
page.

## Display and style data

There are a few ways to display data (tables, arrays, data frames) in Streamlit
apps. [Below](#use-magic), you will be introduced to _magic_
and [`st.write()`](/develop/api-reference/write-magic/st.write), which can be used to write
anything from text to tables. After that, let's take a look at methods designed
specifically for visualizing data.

### Use magic

You can also write to your app without calling any Streamlit methods.
Streamlit supports "[magic commands](/develop/api-reference/write-magic/magic)," which means you don't have to use
[`st.write()`](/develop/api-reference/write-magic/st.write) at all! To see this in action try this snippet:

```python
"""
# My first app
Here's our first attempt at using data to create a table:
"""

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({
  'first column': [1, 2, 3, 4],
  'second column': [10, 20, 30, 40]
})

df
```

Any time that Streamlit sees a variable or a literal
value on its own line, it automatically writes that to your app using
[`st.write()`](/develop/api-reference/write-magic/st.write). For more information, refer to the
documentation on [magic commands](/develop/api-reference/write-magic/magic).

### Write a data frame

Along with [magic commands](/develop/api-reference/write-magic/magic),
[`st.write()`](/develop/api-reference/write-magic/st.write) is Streamlit's "Swiss Army knife". You
can pass almost anything to [`st.write()`](/develop/api-reference/write-magic/st.write):
text, data, Matplotlib figures, Altair charts, and more. Don't worry, Streamlit
will figure it out and render things the right way.

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

st.write("Here's our first attempt at using data to create a table:")
st.write(pd.DataFrame({
    'first column': [1, 2, 3, 4],
    'second column': [10, 20, 30, 40]
}))
```

There are other data specific functions like
[`st.dataframe()`](/develop/api-reference/data/st.dataframe) and
[`st.table()`](/develop/api-reference/data/st.table) that you can also use for displaying
data. Let's understand when to use these features and how to add colors and styling to your data frames.

You might be asking yourself, "why wouldn't I always use `st.write()`?" There are
a few reasons:

1. _Magic_ and [`st.write()`](/develop/api-reference/write-magic/st.write) inspect the type of
   data that you've passed in, and then decide how to best render it in the
   app. Sometimes you want to draw it another way. For example, instead of
   drawing a dataframe as an interactive table, you may want to draw it as a
   static table by using `st.table(df)`.
2. The second reason is that other methods return an object that can be used
   and modified, either by adding data to it or replacing it.
3. Finally, if you use a more specific Streamlit method you can pass additional
   arguments to customize its behavior.

For example, let's create a data frame and change its formatting with a Pandas
`Styler` object. In this example, you'll use Numpy to generate a random sample,
and the [`st.dataframe()`](/develop/api-reference/data/st.dataframe) method to draw an
interactive table.

<Note>

This example uses Numpy to generate a random sample, but you can use Pandas
DataFrames, Numpy arrays, or plain Python arrays.

</Note>

```python
import streamlit as st
import numpy as np

dataframe = np.random.randn(10, 20)
st.dataframe(dataframe)
```

Let's expand on the first example using the Pandas `Styler` object to highlight
some elements in the interactive table.

```python
import streamlit as st
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

dataframe = pd.DataFrame(
    np.random.randn(10, 20),
    columns=('col %d' % i for i in range(20)))

st.dataframe(dataframe.style.highlight_max(axis=0))
```

Streamlit also has a method for static table generation:
[`st.table()`](/develop/api-reference/data/st.table).

```python
import streamlit as st
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

dataframe = pd.DataFrame(
    np.random.randn(10, 20),
    columns=('col %d' % i for i in range(20)))
st.table(dataframe)
```

### Draw charts and maps

Streamlit supports several popular data charting libraries like [Matplotlib,
Altair, deck.gl, and more](/develop/api-reference#chart-elements). In this section, you'll
add a bar chart, line chart, and a map to your app.

### Draw a line chart

You can easily add a line chart to your app with
[`st.line_chart()`](/develop/api-reference/charts/st.line_chart). We'll generate a random
sample using Numpy and then chart it.

```python
import streamlit as st
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

chart_data = pd.DataFrame(
     np.random.randn(20, 3),
     columns=['a', 'b', 'c'])

st.line_chart(chart_data)
```

### Plot a map

With [`st.map()`](/develop/api-reference/charts/st.map) you can display data points on a map.
Let's use Numpy to generate some sample data and plot it on a map of
San Francisco.

```python
import streamlit as st
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

map_data = pd.DataFrame(
    np.random.randn(1000, 2) / [50, 50] + [37.76, -122.4],
    columns=['lat', 'lon'])

st.map(map_data)
```

## Widgets

When you've got the data or model into the state that you want to explore, you
can add in widgets like [`st.slider()`](/develop/api-reference/widgets/st.slider),
[`st.button()`](/develop/api-reference/widgets/st.button) or
[`st.selectbox()`](/develop/api-reference/widgets/st.selectbox). It's really straightforward
â€” treat widgets as variables:

```python
import streamlit as st
x = st.slider('x')  # ðŸ‘ˆ this is a widget
st.write(x, 'squared is', x * x)
```

On first run, the app above should output the text "0 squared is 0". Then
every time a user interacts with a widget, Streamlit simply reruns your script
from top to bottom, assigning the current state of the widget to your variable
in the process.

For example, if the user moves the slider to position `10`, Streamlit will
rerun the code above and set `x` to `10` accordingly. So now you should see the
text "10 squared is 100".

Widgets can also be accessed by key, if you choose to specify a string to use as the unique key for the widget:

```python
import streamlit as st
st.text_input("Your name", key="name")

# You can access the value at any point with:
st.session_state.name
```

Every widget with a key is automatically added to Session State. For more information about Session State, its association with widget state, and its limitations, see [Session State API Reference Guide](/develop/api-reference/caching-and-state/st.session_state).

### Use checkboxes to show/hide data

One use case for checkboxes is to hide or show a specific chart or section in
an app. [`st.checkbox()`](/develop/api-reference/widgets/st.checkbox) takes a single argument,
which is the widget label. In this sample, the checkbox is used to toggle a
conditional statement.

```python
import streamlit as st
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

if st.checkbox('Show dataframe'):
    chart_data = pd.DataFrame(
       np.random.randn(20, 3),
       columns=['a', 'b', 'c'])

    chart_data
```

### Use a selectbox for options

Use [`st.selectbox`](/develop/api-reference/widgets/st.selectbox) to choose from a series. You
can write in the options you want, or pass through an array or data frame
column.

Let's use the `df` data frame we created earlier.

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'first column': [1, 2, 3, 4],
    'second column': [10, 20, 30, 40]
    })

option = st.selectbox(
    'Which number do you like best?',
     df['first column'])

'You selected: ', option
```

## Layout

Streamlit makes it easy to organize your widgets in a left panel sidebar with
[`st.sidebar`](/develop/api-reference/layout/st.sidebar). Each element that's passed to
[`st.sidebar`](/develop/api-reference/layout/st.sidebar) is pinned to the left, allowing
users to focus on the content in your app while still having access to UI
controls.

For example, if you want to add a selectbox and a slider to a sidebar,
use `st.sidebar.slider` and `st.sidebar.selectbox` instead of `st.slider` and
`st.selectbox`:

```python
import streamlit as st

# Add a selectbox to the sidebar:
add_selectbox = st.sidebar.selectbox(
    'How would you like to be contacted?',
    ('Email', 'Home phone', 'Mobile phone')
)

# Add a slider to the sidebar:
add_slider = st.sidebar.slider(
    'Select a range of values',
    0.0, 100.0, (25.0, 75.0)
)
```

Beyond the sidebar, Streamlit offers several other ways to control the layout
of your app. [`st.columns`](/develop/api-reference/layout/st.columns) lets you place widgets side-by-side, and
[`st.expander`](/develop/api-reference/layout/st.expander) lets you conserve space by hiding away large content.

```python
import streamlit as st

left_column, right_column = st.columns(2)
# You can use a column just like st.sidebar:
left_column.button('Press me!')

# Or even better, call Streamlit functions inside a "with" block:
with right_column:
    chosen = st.radio(
        'Sorting hat',
        ("Gryffindor", "Ravenclaw", "Hufflepuff", "Slytherin"))
    st.write(f"You are in {chosen} house!")
```

<Note>

`st.echo` and `st.spinner` are not currently supported inside the sidebar
or layout options. Rest assured, though, we're currently working on adding support for those too!

</Note>

### Show progress

When adding long running computations to an app, you can use
[`st.progress()`](/develop/api-reference/status/st.progress) to display status in real time.

First, let's import time. We're going to use the `time.sleep()` method to
simulate a long running computation:

```python
import time
```

Now, let's create a progress bar:

```python
import streamlit as st
import time

'Starting a long computation...'

# Add a placeholder
latest_iteration = st.empty()
bar = st.progress(0)

for i in range(100):
  # Update the progress bar with each iteration.
  latest_iteration.text(f'Iteration {i+1}')
  bar.progress(i + 1)
  time.sleep(0.1)

'...and now we\'re done!'
```
