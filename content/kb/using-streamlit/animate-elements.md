# How to animate elements?

Let's combine some of the things you've learned to create compelling
animations in your app.

```python
progress_bar = st.progress(0)
status_text = st.empty()
chart = st.line_chart(np.random.randn(10, 2))

for i in range(100):
    # Update progress bar.
    progress_bar.progress(i + 1)

    new_rows = np.random.randn(10, 2)

    # Update status text.
    status_text.text(
        'The latest random number is: %s' % new_rows[-1, 1])

    # Append data to the chart.
    chart.add_rows(new_rows)

    # Pretend we're doing some computation that takes time.
    time.sleep(0.1)

status_text.text('Done!')
st.balloons()
```
