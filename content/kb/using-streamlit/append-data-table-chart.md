# Append data to a table or chart

In Streamlit, you can not only replace entire elements in your app, but also
modify the data behind those elements. Here is how:

```python
import numpy as np
import time

# Get some data.
data = np.random.randn(10, 2)

# Show the data as a chart.
chart = st.line_chart(data)

# Wait 1 second, so the change is clearer.
time.sleep(1)

# Grab some more data.
data2 = np.random.randn(10, 2)

# Append the new data to the existing chart.
chart.add_rows(data2)
```
