# What is the path of Streamlit’s config.toml file?

A global config file is found at `~/.streamlit/config.toml` for macOS/Linux or `%userprofile%/.streamlit/config.toml` for Windows.

A per-project config file can be created at `$CWD/.streamlit/config.toml`, where `$CWD` is the folder you’re running Streamlit from.
