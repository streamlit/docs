# How to download a file in Streamlit?

Use the [`st.download_button`](/develop/api-reference/widgets/st.download_button) widget that is natively built into Streamlit. Check out a [sample app](https://streamlit-release-demos-0-88streamlit-app-0-88-v8ram3.streamlit.app/) demonstrating how you can use `st.download_button` to download common file formats.

## Example usage

```python
import streamlit as st

# Text files

text_contents = '''
Foo, Bar
123, 456
789, 000
'''

# Different ways to use the API

st.download_button('Download CSV', text_contents, 'text/csv')
st.download_button('Download CSV', text_contents)  # Defaults to 'text/plain'

with open('myfile.csv') as f:
   st.download_button('Download CSV', f)  # Defaults to 'text/plain'

# ---
# Binary files

binary_contents = b'whatever'

# Different ways to use the API

st.download_button('Download file', binary_contents)  # Defaults to 'application/octet-stream'

with open('myfile.zip', 'rb') as f:
   st.download_button('Download Zip', f, file_name='archive.zip')  # Defaults to 'application/octet-stream'

# You can also grab the return value of the button,
# just like with any other button.

if st.download_button(...):
   st.write('Thanks for downloading!')
```
