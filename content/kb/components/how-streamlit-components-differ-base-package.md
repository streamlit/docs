# How do Streamlit Components differ from functionality provided in the base Streamlit package?

- Streamlit Components are wrapped up in an iframe, which gives you the ability to do whatever you want (within the iframe) using any web technology you like.

- There is a strict message protocol between Components and Streamlit, which makes possible for Components to act as widgets. As Streamlit Components are wrapped in iframe, they cannot modify their parentâ€™s DOM (a.k.a the Streamlit report), which ensures that Streamlit is always secure even with user-written components.
