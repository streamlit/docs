# Enabling camera or microphone access in your browser

Streamlit apps may include a widget to upload images from your camera or record sound with your microphone. To
safeguard the users' privacy and security, browsers require users to explicitly allow access to their
camera or microphone before those devices can be used.

To learn how to enable camera access, please check the documentation for your browser:
