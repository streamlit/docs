# Connect Streamlit to Microsoft SQL Server

## Introduction

This guide explains how to securely access a **_remote_** Microsoft SQL Server database from Streamlit Community Cloud. It uses the [pyodbc](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/wiki) library and Streamlit's [Secrets management](/streamlit-community-cloud/deploy-your-app/secrets-management).

## Create an SQL Server database

<Note>

If you already have a remote database that you want to use, feel free
to [skip to the next step](#add-username-and-password-to-your-local-app-secrets).

</Note>

First, follow the Microsoft documentation to install [SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/sql/sql-server/?view=sql-server-ver15) and the `sqlcmd` [Utility](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/sql/tools/sqlcmd-utility?view=sql-server-ver15). They have detailed installation guides on how to:

- [Install SQL Server on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/sql/database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15)
- [Install on Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-red-hat?view=sql-server-ver15)
- [Install on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-suse?view=sql-server-ver15)
- [Install on Ubuntu](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-ubuntu?view=sql-server-ver15)
- [Run on Docker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-docker?view=sql-server-ver15)
- [Provision a SQL VM in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/sql/provision-sql-server-linux-virtual-machine?toc=/sql/toc/toc.json)

Once you have SQL Server installed, note down your SQL Server name, username, and password during setup.

## Connect locally

If you are connecting locally, use `sqlcmd` to connect to your new local SQL Server instance.

1. In your terminal, run the following command:

   ```bash
   sqlcmd -S localhost -U SA -P '<YourPassword>'
   ```

   As you are connecting locally, the SQL Server name is `localhost`, the username is `SA`, and the password is the one you provided during the SA account setup.

2. You should see a **sqlcmd** command prompt `1>`, if successful.

3. If you run into a connection failure, review Microsoft's connection troubleshooting recommendations for your OS ([Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-troubleshooting-guide?view=sql-server-ver15#connection) & [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-troubleshooting-guide?view=sql-server-ver15#connection)).

<Tip>

When connecting remotely, the SQL Server name is the machine name or IP address. You might also need to open the SQL Server TCP port (default 1433) on your firewall.

</Tip>

### Create a SQL Server database

By now, you have SQL Server running and have connected to it with `sqlcmd`! ü•≥ Let's put it to use by creating a database containing a table with some example values.

1. From the `sqlcmd` command prompt, run the following Transact-SQL command to create a test database `mydb`:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE mydb
   ```

2. To execute the above command, type `GO` on a new line:

   ```sql
   GO
   ```

### Insert some data

Next create a new table, `mytable`, in the `mydb` database with three columns and two rows.

1. Switch to the new `mydb` database:

   ```sql
   USE mydb
   ```

2. Create a new table with the following schema:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE mytable (name varchar(80), pet varchar(80))
   ```

3. Insert some data into the table:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO mytable VALUES ('Mary', 'dog'), ('John', 'cat'), ('Robert', 'bird')
   ```

4. Type `GO` to execute the above commands:

   ```sql
   GO
   ```

To end your **sqlcmd** session, type `QUIT` on a new line.

### Add username and password to your local app secrets

Your local Streamlit app will read secrets from a file `.streamlit/secrets.toml` in your app's root directory. Create this file if it doesn't exist yet and add the SQL Server name, database name, username, and password as shown below:

```toml
# .streamlit/secrets.toml

server = "localhost"
database = "mydb"
username = "SA"
password = "xxx"
```

<Important>

When copying your app secrets to Streamlit Community Cloud, be sure to replace the values of **server**, **database**, **username**, and **password** with those of your _remote_ SQL Server!

And add this file to `.gitignore` and don't commit it to your GitHub repo.

</Important>

## Copy your app secrets to Streamlit Community Cloud

As the `secrets.toml` file above is not committed to GitHub, you need to pass its content to your deployed app (on Streamlit Community Cloud) separately. Go to the [app dashboard](https://share.streamlit.io/) and in the app's dropdown menu, click on **Edit Secrets**. Copy the content of `secrets.toml` into the text area. More information is available at [Secrets management](/streamlit-community-cloud/deploy-your-app/secrets-management).

## Add pyodbc to your requirements file

To connect to SQL Server _locally_ with Streamlit, you need to `pip install pyodbc`, in addition to the Microsoft ODBC driver you installed during the SQL Server installation.

On _Streamlit Cloud_, we have built-in support for SQL Server. On popular demand, we directly added SQL Server tools including the ODBC drivers and the executables `sqlcmd` and `bcp` to the container image for Cloud apps, so you don't need to install them.

All you need to do is add the [`pyodbc`](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc) Python package to your `requirements.txt` file, and you're ready to go! üéà

```bash
# requirements.txt
pyodbc==x.x.x
```

Replace `x.x.x` ‚òùÔ∏è with the version of pyodbc you want installed on Cloud.

<Note>

At this time, Streamlit Community Cloud does not support Azure Active Directory authentication. We will update this tutorial when we add support for Azure Active Directory.

</Note>

## Write your Streamlit app

Copy the code below to your Streamlit app and run it. Make sure to adapt `query` to use the name of your table.

```python
import streamlit as st
import pyodbc

# Initialize connection.
# Uses st.cache_resource to only run once.
@st.cache_resource
def init_connection():
    return pyodbc.connect(
        "DRIVER={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};SERVER="
        + st.secrets["server"]
        + ";DATABASE="
        + st.secrets["database"]
        + ";UID="
        + st.secrets["username"]
        + ";PWD="
        + st.secrets["password"]
    )

conn = init_connection()

# Perform query.
# Uses st.cache_data to only rerun when the query changes or after 10 min.
@st.cache_data(ttl=600)
def run_query(query):
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        cur.execute(query)
        return cur.fetchall()

rows = run_query("SELECT * from mytable;")

# Print results.
for row in rows:
    st.write(f"{row[0]} has a :{row[1]}:")

```

See `st.cache_data` above? Without it, Streamlit would run the query every time the app reruns (e.g. on a widget interaction). With `st.cache_data`, it only runs when the query changes or after 10 minutes (that's what `ttl` is for). Watch out: If your database updates more frequently, you should adapt `ttl` or remove caching so viewers always see the latest data. Learn more in [Caching](/library/advanced-features/caching).

If everything worked out (and you used the example table we created above), your app should look like this:
