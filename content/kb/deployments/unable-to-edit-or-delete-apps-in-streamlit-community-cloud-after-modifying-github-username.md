# Unable to edit or delete apps in Streamlit Community Cloud after modifying GitHub username

## Problem

After updating the GitHub username, apps cannot be edited or deleted from Streamlit Community Cloud.

## Solution

- Support can delete your old applications that were deployed before updating the GitHub username.
- Once deleted, you can redeploy the applications using the new GitHub username.
- Please contact [Support](mailto:support@streamlit.io) with **a list of the URLs for the apps** you need to be deleted.
