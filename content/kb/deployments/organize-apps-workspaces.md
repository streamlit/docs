# Organizing your apps with workspaces on Streamlit Community Cloud

Streamlit Community Cloud is organized into workspaces, which automatically group your apps according to the corresponding GitHub repository's owner. If you are part of multiple repositories, then you will have multiple workspaces.

## Personal workspace

If an app's GitHub repository is owned by you, the app will appear in your personal workspace, named "<YourGitHubHandle\>".

## Organization workspace

If an app's GitHub repository is owned by **an organization** (such as your company), the app will appear in a separate workspace, named "<GitHubOrganizationHandle\>".

## Workspaces with view access

You will also have access to any workspaces containing app(s) for which you only have **view access**. These apps will have a "view-only" tooltip when you click on their respective overflow menu icons (â‹®).
