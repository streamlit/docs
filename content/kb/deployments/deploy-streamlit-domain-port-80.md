# How do I deploy Streamlit on a domain so it appears to run on a regular port (i.e. port 80)?

## Problem

You want to deploy a Streamlit app on a domain so it appears to run on port 80.

## Solution

- You should use a **reverse proxy** to forward requests from a webserver like [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) or [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) to the port where your Streamlit app is running. You can accomplish this in several different ways. The simplest way is to [forward all requests sent to your domain](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/permission-denied-in-ec2-port-80/798/3) so that your Streamlit app appears as the content of your website.

- Another approach is to configureÂ your webserver to forward requests to designated subfolders (e.g. _http://awesomestuff.net/streamlitapp_) to different Streamlit apps on the same domain, as in this [example config for Nginx](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/how-to-use-streamlit-with-nginx/378/7) submitted by a Streamlit community member.
