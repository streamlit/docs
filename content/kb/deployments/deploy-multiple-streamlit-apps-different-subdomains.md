# How can I deploy multiple Streamlit apps on different subdomains?

## Problem

You want to deploy multiple Streamlit apps on different subdomains.

## Solution

Like running your Streamlit app on more common ports such as 80, subdomains are handled by a web server like Apache or Nginx:

- Set up a web server on a machine with a public IP address, then use a DNS server to point all desired subdomains to your webserver's IP address

- Configure your web server to route requests for each subdomain to the different ports that your Streamlit apps are running on

For example, letâ€™s say you had two Streamlit apps called `Calvin` and `Hobbes`. App `Calvin` is running on port **8501**. You set up app `Hobbes` to run on port **8502**. Your webserver would then be set up to "listen" for requests on subdomains `calvin.somedomain.com` and `hobbes.subdomain.com`, and route requests to port **8501** and **8502**, respectively.

Check out these two tutorials for Apache2 and Nginx that deal with setting up a webserver to redirect subdomains to different ports:
