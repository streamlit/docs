# How to delete your Streamlit Community Cloud account

Deleting your Streamlit Community Cloud account is just as easy as creating it via the Settings tab. When you delete your account, your information, account, and all your hosted apps are deleted as well.

<Warning>

Deleting your account is permanent and cannot be undone. Make sure you really want to delete your account and all hosted apps before proceeding.
