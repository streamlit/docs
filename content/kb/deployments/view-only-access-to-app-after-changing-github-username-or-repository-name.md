# View-only access to app after changing GitHub username or repository name

This KB helps to resolve the issue of the apps becoming view-only.

## Problem

When opening the dropdown menu of the apps on Streamlit Community CLoud, the options Reboot, Delete and Settings is grayed out, and there is a message "You have view-only access to this application".

Changing your GitHub username or the repository name after deploying an app causes your app to become view-only.

## Solution

Please reach out to the [Snowflake support team](mailto:support@streamlit.io) to delete the affected app(s) for you so you can redeploy them with your new username.
