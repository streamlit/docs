# How to clean install Streamlit

If you run into any issues while installing Streamlit or if you want to do a clean install, don't worry, we've got you covered. In this guide, we'll show you how to clean install Streamlit for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Install Streamlit on Windows

Streamlit's officially-supported environment manager on Windows is [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/).

### Install Anaconda

If you don't have Anaconda install yet, follow the steps provided on the [Anaconda installation page](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/).

### Create a new environment with Streamlit

Next you'll need to set up your environment.

1. Follow the steps provided by Anaconda to [set up and manage your environment](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/getting-started/#managing-environments) using the Anaconda Navigator.

2. Select the "â–¶" icon next to your new environment. Then select "Open terminal":

3. In the terminal that appears, type:

   ```sh
   pip install streamlit
   ```

4. Test that the installation worked:

   ```sh
   streamlit hello
   ```

   Streamlit's Hello app should appear in a new tab in your web browser!

### Use your new environment

1. In Anaconda Navigator, open a terminal in your environment (see step 2 above).
2. In the terminal that appears, use Streamlit as usual:

   ```sh
   streamlit run myfile.py
   ```

## Install Streamlit on macOS/Linux

Streamlit's officially-supported environment manager for macOS and Linux is [Pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/). See instructions on how to install and use it below.

### Install Pipenv

1. Install `pip`.

   On a macOS:

   ```sh
   sudo easy_install pip
   ```

   On Ubuntu with Python 3:

   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install python3-pip
   ```

   For other Linux distributions, see [How to install PIP for Python](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-pip-for-python/).

2. Install `pipenv`.

   ```sh
   pip3 install pipenv
   ```

### Create a new environment with Streamlit

1. Navigate to your project folder:

   ```sh
   cd myproject
   ```

2. Create a new Pipenv environment in that folder and activate that environment:

   ```sh
   pipenv shell
   ```

   When you run the command above, a file called `Pipfile` will appear in `myprojects/`. This file is where your Pipenv environment and its dependencies are declared.

3. Install Streamlit in your environment:

   ```sh
   pip install streamlit
   ```

   Or if you want to create an easily-reproducible environment, replace `pip` with `pipenv` every time you install something:

   ```sh
   pipenv install streamlit
   ```

4. Test that the installation worked:

   ```sh
   streamlit hello
   ```

   Streamlit's Hello app should appear in a new tab in your web browser!

### Use your new environment

1. Any time you want to use the new environment, you first need to go to your project folder (where the `Pipenv` file lives) and run:

   ```sh
   pipenv shell
   ```

2. Now you can use Python and Streamlit as usual:

   ```sh
   streamlit run myfile.py
   ```

3. When you're done using this environment, just type `exit` or press `ctrl-D` to return to your normall shell.
