# Favorite your app

Streamlit Community Cloud supports a "favorite" feature that lets you quickly access your apps from the app dashboard. Favorited apps appear at the top of the app dashboard with a yellow star (‚≠ê) beside them. You can favorite and unfavorite apps in any workspace to which you have access.

<Note>

Favorites are specific to your account. Other members of your workspace cannot see which apps you have favorited.

</Note>

## Favoriting and unfavoriting your app

You can favorite your app [From your workspace](#from-your-workspace) or [From your app](#from-your-app)! Currently, in-app favoriting is available for apps that use Streamlit v1.4.0 or later. Note that in-app favoriting is not available on apps in your workspaces for which you only have view access.

### From your workspace

1. From your workspace at [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io), click the overflow icon (<i style={{ verticalAlign: "-.25em" }} className={{ class: "material-icons-sharp" }}>more_vert</i>) next to your app. Click "**Favorite**".

* Once favorited, from the same menu, click "**Unfavorite**" to remove the star.

Alternatively, you can favorite and unfavorite apps by clicking directly on the star next to their names. (Hover over an unfavorited app to reveal an empty star icon next to its name.)

### From your app

From your app at `<your-custom-subdomain>.streamlit.app`, click the star (<i style={{ verticalAlign: "-.25em" }} className={{ class: "material-icons-sharp" }}>star_border</i>/<i style={{ verticalAlign: "-.25em", color: "#faca2b" }} className={{ class: "material-icons-sharp" }}>star</i>) in the upper-right corner to toggle your app's favorite status.
