# Welcome to Streamlit Community Cloud

Deploy, manage, and share your Streamlit apps with the world in minutes &mdash; all for free. Your Streamlit Community Cloud account connects directly to your GitHub repository (public or private). Most apps will launch in only a few minutes. Streamlit Community Cloud handles all of the containerization so all you need to worry about is creating the app. Rapidly prototype, explore, and update apps by simply changing your code in GitHub. Most changes appear immediately!

Want to avoid the work of setting up a local development environment? Community Cloud can help you quickly configure a codespace to develop in the cloud. Whether it's your own deployed app or an app deployed from a public repository, it only takes a few clicks to start coding or editing a Streamlit app. See [Edit your app](/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app/edit-your-app).

If you haven't built your first Streamlit app yet, you can check out [Get started](/get-started) in our Streamlit library documentation or [Fork and edit a public app](/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/fork-and-edit-a-public-app) from our <a href="https://streamlit.io/gallery" target="_blank">App gallery</a>. Check out [Community Cloud quickstart](/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started) to speed-run you through creating your account, deploying an example app, and editing it using GitHub Codespaces.
