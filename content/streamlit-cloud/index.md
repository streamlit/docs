# Welcome to Streamlit Community Cloud

Deploy, manage, and share your Streamlit apps with the world in minutes &mdash; all for free. Your Streamlit Community Cloud account connects directly to your GitHub repository (public or private). Most apps will launch in only a few minutes. Streamlit Community Cloud handles all of the containerization so all you need to worry about is creating the app. Rapidly prototype, explore, and update apps by simply changing your code in GitHub. Most changes appear immediately!

If you haven't built your first Streamlit app yet, you can check out [Get started](/library/get-started) in our Streamlit library documentation, fork an app from our <a href="https://streamlit.io/gallery" target="_blank">App gallery</a>, or go with [Quickstart](/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/quickstart) which will speed-run you through creating your account and deploying an example app.
