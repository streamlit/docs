# Deploy on Streamlit Cloud

Now that you've created your app, you're ready to share it! You can use [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) to deploy and share your app. Streamlit Cloud has multiple tiers:

- The [Community tier](/streamlit-cloud/community) (formerly Streamlit sharing) is the perfect solution if your app is hosted in a public GitHub repo and youâ€™d like anyone in the world to be able to access it **for free**!
- The [Enterprise tier](/streamlit-cloud/enterprise) offers access controls, the ability to securely deploy apps from private repos, customize resources, and much more.
