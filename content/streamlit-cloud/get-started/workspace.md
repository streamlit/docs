# Explore your Streamlit Community Cloud workspace

Congrats! You are now logged in and ready to go. If you are joining someone else's workspace you may already see apps populated in your workspace. If not, then you need to deploy an app! Check out our next section on how to [Deploy your app](/streamlit-community-cloud/deploy-your-app). If you need an app to deploy, check out our [example apps](https://streamlit-cloud-example-apps-streamlit-app-sw3u0r.streamlit.app/) that include apps for machine learning, data science, and business use cases. You can read more about connecting to someone else's workspace in [Connect GitHub](http://localhost:3000/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/connect-github).

You may also find that you already have multiple Streamlit Community Cloud workspaces. Streamlit Community Cloud automatically groups your apps according to the corresponding GitHub repository's owner or organzation. In the upper right corner you can see the workspaces you have access to. If apps have already been deployed from any of your repositories, then you will see those apps in your workspace. Learn more about [App workspaces](/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app#app-workspaces).

## Invite other developers to your workspace

Inviting other developers is simple, just invite them to your GitHub repository so that you can code on apps together, and then have them log in to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io). Read more about connecting to a GitHub organization in [Connect GitHub](http://localhost:3000/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/connect-github).

Streamlit Community Cloud inherits developer permissions from GitHub, so when your teammates log in, they will automatically view the workspaces you share. From there you can all deploy, manage, and share apps together.

<Note>

Once a user is added to a repository on GitHub, it will take at most 15 minutes before they can deploy the app on Cloud. If a user is removed from a repository on GitHub, it will take at most 15 minutes before their permissions to manage the app from that repository are revoked.

</Note>

And remember, whenever anyone on the team updates the code on GitHub, the app will also automatically update for you!
