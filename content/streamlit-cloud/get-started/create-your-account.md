# Create your account

Before you can start deploying apps for the world to see, you need to sign up for your Streamlit Community Cloud account.

Streamlit Community Cloud accounts have two underlying identities: primary and source control. Your primary identity is used for viewing analytics as well as viewing permissions. Your source-control identity is used for deploying and managing apps.

## Sign up

Although you can begin the sign-up process with GitHub, we recommend starting with Google or email in order to have a complete account from the start.
* Step 1: Primary identity (Google or email)
* Step 2: Source control (GitHub)
* Step 3: Set up your account

### Step 1: Primary identity

Your primary identity is associated to an email. You can log in through Google or through emailed sign-in links which are valid for 15 minutes once requested.

If you're sharing a private app, you will assign viewing permission by email. Therefore, your app's users will need to log in with either Google or emailed links.

#### Primary identity option 1: Google

1. Go to [share.streamlit.io/sigup]()
2. Click "**Continute with Google**".

3. Enter your Google credentials and continue.
4. If you will be deploying or managing any apps, click "**Connect GitHub account**" and proceed to Step 2: GitHub. If you are only going to be viewing apps and will not be using GitHub, you can click "**Skip this step**" and proceed to Step 3: Set up your account.

#### Primary identity option 2: email

1. Go to [share.streamlit.io/sigup]()
2. Enter your email address and click "**Continute with email**".

3. A confirmation screen will display, telling you to check your email.

4. Go to your email inbox and open the email from "noreply@streamlit.io". Click the link to sign in.
5. If you will be deploying or managing any apps, click "**Connect GitHub account**" and proceed to Step 2: GitHub. If you are only going to be viewing apps and will not be using GitHub, you can click "**Skip this step**" and proceed to Step 3: Set up your account.

### Step 2: Source control

Streamlit Community Cloud is integreated with GitHub for source control. If you begin your sign-up process with GitHub, you will not be directly prompted to create a primary identity. However, you can attach a Google account later.

There are two different authorization requests that will occur when you [Connect GitHub](http://localhost:3000/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/connect-github) to your account. You will encounter the first authorization request when you connect your GitHub account. A second authorization is needed the first time you deploy an app.

1. After completing Step 1: Primary identity or after clicking "**Continue with GitHub**" from the sign-up page, enter your GitHub credentials and click "**Sign in**".

2. Click "**Authorize streamlit**".

3. Continue to Step 3: Set up your account

### Step 3: Set up your account

As a final step to account creation, we ask users about themselves and their experience with Streamlit. This is also when users acknowledge our [Terms of use](https://www.streamlit.io/sharing/terms-of-use) and [Privacy notice](https://streamlit.io/privacy-policy). The email you provide in this survey is not used as your account email.

1. Fill in your information and click "**Continue**" at the bottom of the screen

2. You will be taken to your workspace.
