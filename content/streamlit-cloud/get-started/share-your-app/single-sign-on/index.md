# Configuring Single Sign-on (SSO)

By default all apps deployed with Streamlit Cloud Teams and Enterprise are private, which means that others in your company won't be able to view them unless you give them explicit permission.

If your organization uses **Google OAuth**, you're all set â€” just click "Continue with Google" to sign into Streamlit Cloud. If your organization uses another SSO provider, check out our guides below.

- [Microsoft Active Directory (ADFS)](/streamlit-cloud/get-started/share-your-app/configuring-single-on-sso/streamlit-active-directory-adfs)

- [Microsoft Azure authentication](/streamlit-cloud/get-started/share-your-app/configuring-single-on-sso/streamlit-azure-active-directory)

- [Okta](/streamlit-cloud/get-started/share-your-app/configuring-single-on-sso/streamlit-okta-sso)

- [Generic SAML](/streamlit-cloud/get-started/share-your-app/configuring-single-on-sso/streamlit-general-saml-authentication)
