# Get started

Welcome to Streamlit Community Cloud! First things first, before you get started with Streamlit Community Cloud, you need to have a Streamlit app to deploy. If you haven't built one yet, read our [Get started](/library/get-started) docs or start with an [Example app](https://streamlit-cloud-example-apps-streamlit-app-sw3u0r.streamlit.app/). Either way, it only takes a few minutes to create your first app.

<Tip>

Do you want to hurry up and deploy an app as fast as possible? Try out [Quickstart](/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/quickstart) for a concise set of steps to create your account, fork an example, and deploy it right away. You can always come back here for more explanation.

## How Streamlit Community Cloud works

Streamlit Community Cloud is a workspace for you to deploy, manage, and collaborate on your Streamlit apps. You connect your Streamlit Community Cloud account directly to your GitHub repository (public or private) and then Streamlit Community Cloud launches the apps directly from the code you've stored on GitHub. Most apps will launch in only a few minutes. Any time you update the code on GitHub, your app will automatically update for you. This creates a fast iteration cycle for your deployed apps so developers and viewers can rapidly prototype, explore, and update apps.

Under the hood Streamlit Community Cloud handles all of the containerization and authentication so that all you need to worry about is creating the app. Maintaining Streamlit apps is easy. Containers get the latest security patches and are actively monitored for container health.
