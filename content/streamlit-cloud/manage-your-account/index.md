# Manage your account

You can update or delete your account through "**Settings**." When using Streamlit Community Cloud, you have two kinds of logins: a primary identity (email) and source control (GitHub). Your primary identity is used for viewing private apps that are shared with you. Source control is used to access app deployment and management.
