# Manage your account

You can [update the email](/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-account/update-your-email) associated with your account or [delete your account](/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-account/delete-your-account) entirely through "**Settings**." When using [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/), you have two kinds of logins: a primary identity (email) and source control (GitHub). Your primary identity allows other users to share private apps with you. Your source control identity allows you to deploy apps from GitHub repositories and manage them through the Streamlit Community Cloud dashboard.

## Access your account settings

To manage your account, sign in to https://share.streamlit.io and click "**Settings**" in the top right corner.

Doing so opens your "**Workspace settings**," where you can update your email or delete your account.

You can find the detailed steps for each option in [Update your email](/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-account/update-your-email) and [Delete your account](/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-account/delete-your-account).
