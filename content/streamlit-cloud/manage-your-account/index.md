# Manage your account

You can [Update your email](/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-account/update-your-email) or [Delete your account](/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-account/delete-your-account) entirely through [Workspace settings](/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-account/workspace-settings).

When using Streamlit Community Cloud, you have two identities behind your account: a primary identity (Google or email) and source control (GitHub). Your primary identity allows other users to share private apps with you and grant you access to their analytics. Your source control identity allows you to deploy apps from GitHub repositories and manage them through your Streamlit Community Cloud workspace.

## Access your workspace settings

To manage your account, sign in to <a href="https://share.streamlit.io" target="_blank">share.streamlit.io</a> and click "**Settings**" in the top right corner to access your workspace settings.
