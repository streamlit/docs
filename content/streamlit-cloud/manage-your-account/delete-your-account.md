# Delete your account

Deleting your Streamlit Community Cloud account is just as easy as creating it via "**Settings**". When you delete your account, your information, account, and all your hosted apps are deleted as well.

<Warning>

Deleting your account is permanent and cannot be undone. Make sure you really want to delete your account and all hosted apps before proceeding.

</Warning>
