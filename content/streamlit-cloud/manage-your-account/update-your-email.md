# Update your email

If you ever want to update your email on Streamlit Community Cloud, you can do so via "**Settings**." This will change the primary identity of your account. If your account's email is associated to a Google account, then you can sign in using Google OAuth. Otherwise, you can sign in via emailed links which are valid for 15 minutes once generated.

## How to update your email

1. Ensure you are logged in to [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/).
2. Click "**Settings**" in the pageâ€™s top-right corner.

6. In your email, you will receive a confirmation link that is valid for 15 minutes once generated. Be sure to access the link from the same browser session where you are logged in to Streamlit Community Cloud.
    <Warning>

    If you access the confirmation link from a browser session where you are not logged in to Streamlit Community Cloud, the confirmation link will not complete the process. You will be prompted to sign in. If you try to sign in with your new email, you will instead create a second account. See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).
    
    </Warning>

## Resend your confirmation link

If your confirmation link expires, you can resend it.

1. Confirm you are logged in to [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/) and go to "**Settings**" as described above.
2. Click "**Update pending**"

3. Click "**Resend email**"

4. Continue from step 4 as described above.

## Troubleshooting

If you click the confirmation link in a browser session where you are not signed in, you will be informed that "Sign in is required." If you try to sign in with your new email, you will instead create a second account. You will not be able to resend your confirmation link while you have this second account. If you accidentally created a second account, you can [delete it](/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-account/delete-your-account), then [resend your confirmation link](#resend-your-confirmation-link) from your first account.
