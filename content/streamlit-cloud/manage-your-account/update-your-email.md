# Update your email

If you wish to update your email on Streamlit Community Cloud, you can do so via your [Workspace settings](/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-account/workspace-settings). Updating your email changes the primary identity of your account. Once updated, if your account's email is associated with a Google account, you can sign in with Google OAuth. Otherwise, you through emailed links. The latter involves typing in your email, after which we'll send you a unique, single-use link (valid for 15 minutes).

If you are signed in to GitHub and don't already have a primary identity on your account, see [Connect Google to your account](#connect-google-to-your-account).

1. Sign in to Streamlit Community Cloud at <a href="https://share.streamlit.io" target="_blank">share.streamlit.io</a>.

7. Check your inbox for an email from Streamlit containing a "**Change email**" button and a confirmation link. This one-time link expires in 15 minutes. Click either one to confirm your new email address for Streamlit Community Cloud. Before doing so, ensure you access the link from the same browser session where you are logged in to Streamlit Community Cloud.

   <Important>

   If you access the confirmation link from a browser session where you are not logged in to Streamlit Community Cloud, the confirmation link will not complete the process. You will be prompted to sign in. If you try to sign in with your new email, you will create a second account instead. See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

   </Important>

## Resend your confirmation link

If your confirmation link expires, don't worry! You can resend it by following these steps:

1. Sign in to Streamlit Community Cloud at <a href="https://share.streamlit.io" target="_blank">share.streamlit.io</a> and click "**Settings**" in the page's top-right corner.
2. Click "**Update pending**"

4. Continue from step 4 of [How to update your email](#how-to-update-your-email).

## Troubleshooting

If you click the confirmation link in a browser session where you are not signed in, you will be informed that "Sign in is required." If you try to sign in with your new email, you will create a second account instead. You cannot resend your confirmation link while you have this second account. If you accidentally created a second account, you can follow the steps to [Delete your account](/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-account/delete-your-account) to get rid of the duplicate. Afterwards, [Resend your confirmation link](#resend-your-confirmation-link) from your first account.
