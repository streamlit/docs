### Community Cloud

On Community Cloud, if your app is not configured for authentication, `st.experimental_user` will have a single attribute: `email`. If a user is logged in and a member of your app's workspace, this will return the user's email. For all other cases, it returns `None`.

On Community Cloud, if your app is configured for authentication (`[auth]` exists in your app's secrets), `st.experimental_user` will behave the same as a locally running app. Remember to update your identity provider's configuration and your app's secrets to allow your new domain. A list of [IP addresses](/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/status#ip-addresses) used by Community Cloud is available if needed. An authentication-configured app counts as your one, allowed private app.
