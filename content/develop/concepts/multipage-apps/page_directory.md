# Creating multipage apps using the `pages/` directory

The most customizable method for declaring multipage apps is using [Page and navigation](/develop/concepts/multipage-apps/page-and-navigation). However, Streamlit also provides a frictionless way to create multipage apps where pages are automatically recognized and shown in a navigation widget inside your app's sidebar. This method uses the `pages/` directory.

This page assumes you understand the [Page terminology](/develop/concepts/multipage-apps/overview#page-terminology) presented in the overview.

## App structure

When you use the `pages/` directory, Streamlit identifies pages in your multipage app by directory structure and filenames. Your entrypoint file (the file you pass to `streamlit run`), is your app's homepage. When you have a `pages/` directory next to your entrypoint file, Streamlit will identify each Python file within it as a page. The following example has three pages. `your_homepage.py` is the entrypoint file and homepage.

```
your_working_directory/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ a_page.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ another_page.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ your_homepage.py
```

Run your multipage app just like you would for a single-page app. Pass your entrypoint file to `streamlit run`.

```
streamlit run your_homepage.py
```

Only `.py` files in the `pages/` directory will be identified as pages. Streamlit ignores all other files in the `pages/` directory and its subdirectories. Streamlit also ignores Python files in subdirectories of `pages/`.

<Important>

If you call `st.navigation` in your app (in any session), Streamlit will switch to using the newer, Page-and-navigation multipage structure. In this case, the `pages/` directory will be ignored across all sessions. You will not be able to revert back to the `pages/` directory unless you restart you app.

### How pages are sorted in the sidebar

See the overview to understand how Streamlit assigns [Automatic page labels and URLs](/develop/concepts/multipage-apps/overview#automatic-page-labels-and-urls) based on the `number`, `separator`, `identifier`, and `".py"` extension that constitute a filename.

The entrypoint file is always displayed first. The remaining pages are sorted as follows:

- Files that have a `number` appear before files without a `number`.
- Files are sorted based on the `number` (if any), followed by the `label` (if any).
- When files are sorted, Streamlit treats the `number` as an actual number rather than a string. So `03` is the same as `3`.

This table shows examples of filenames and their corresponding labels, sorted by the order in which they appear in the sidebar.

**Examples**:

| **Filename**              | **Rendered label** |
| :------------------------ | :----------------- |
| `1 - first page.py`       | first page         |
| `12 monkeys.py`           | monkeys            |
| `123.py`                  | 123                |
| `123_hello_dear_world.py` | hello dear world   |
| `_12 monkeys.py`          | 12 monkeys         |

<Tip>

Emojis can be used to make your page names more fun! For example, a file named `üè†_Home.py` will create a page titled "üè† Home" in the sidebar. When adding emojis to filenames, it‚Äôs best practice to include a numbered prefix to make autocompletion in your terminal easier. Terminal-autocomplete can get confused by unicode (which is how emojis are represented).

## Notes and limitations

- Pages support run-on-save.
  - When you update a page while your app is running, this causes a rerun for users currently viewing that exact page.
  - When you update a page while your app is running, the app will not automatically rerun for users currently viewing a different page.
- While your app is running, adding or deleting a page updates the sidebar navigation immediately.
- [`st.set_page_config`](/develop/api-reference/configuration/st.set_page_config) works at the page level.
  - When you set `title` or `favicon` using `st.set_page_config`, this applies to the current page only.
  - When you set `layout` using `st.set_page_config`, the setting will remain for the session until changed by another call to `st.set_page_config`. If you use `st.set_page_config` to set `layout`, it's recommended to call it on _all_ pages.
- Pages share the same Python modules globally:

  ```python
  # page1.py
  import foo
  foo.hello = 123

  # page2.py
  import foo
  st.write(foo.hello)  # If page1 already executed, this writes 123
  ```

- Pages share the same [st.session_state](/develop/concepts/architecture/session-state):

  ```python
  # page1.py
  import streamlit as st
  if "shared" not in st.session_state:
     st.session_state["shared"] = True

  # page2.py
  import streamlit as st
  st.write(st.session_state["shared"]) # If page1 already executed, this writes True
  ```

You now have a solid understanding of multipage apps. You've learned how to structure apps, define pages, and navigate between pages in the user interface. It's time to [create your first multipage app](/get-started/tutorials/create-a-multipage-app)! ü•≥
