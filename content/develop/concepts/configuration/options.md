# Working with configuration options

Streamlit provides four different ways to set configuration options. This list is in reverse order of precedence, i.e. command line flags take precedence over environment variables when the same configuration option is provided multiple times.

<Note>

If you change theme settings in `.streamlit/config.toml` _while_ the app is running, these changes will reflect immediately. If you change non-theme settings in `.streamlit/config.toml` _while_ the app is running, the server needs to be restarted for changes to be reflected in the app.

</Note>

1. In a **global config file** at `~/.streamlit/config.toml` for macOS/Linux or `%userprofile%/.streamlit/config.toml` for Windows:

   ```toml
   [server]
   port = 80
   ```

2. In a **per-project config file** at `$CWD/.streamlit/config.toml`, where
   `$CWD` is the folder you're running Streamlit from.

3. Through `STREAMLIT_*` **environment variables**, such as:

   ```bash
   export STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT=80
   export STREAMLIT_SERVER_COOKIE_SECRET=dontforgottochangeme
   ```

4. As **flags on the command line** when running `streamlit run`:

   ```bash
   streamlit run your_script.py --server.port 80
   ```

## Available options

All available configuration options are documented in [`config.toml`](/develop/api-reference/configuration/config.toml). These options may be declared in a TOML file, as environment variables, or as command line options.

When using environment variables to override `config.toml`, convert the variable (including its section header) to upper snake case and add a `STREAMLIT_` prefix. For example, `STREAMLIT_CLIENT_SHOW_ERROR_DETAILS` is equivalent to the following in TOML:

```toml
[client]
showErrorDetails = true
```

When using command line options to override `config.toml` and environment variables, use the same case as you would in the TOML file and include the section header as a period-separated prefix. For example, the command line option `--server.enableStaticServing true` is equivalent to the following:

```toml
[server]
enableStaticServing = true
```

## Theming

You can change the base colors of your app using the `[theme]` section of the configuration system.
To learn more, see [Theming.](/develop/concepts/configuration/theming)

## View all configuration options

As described in [Command-line options](/develop/api-reference/cli), you can
view all available configuration options using:

```bash
streamlit config show
```
