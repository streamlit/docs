## **Version 1.38.0**

_Release date: August 27, 2024_

**Highlights**

- 📈 Streamlit natively supports more dataframe formats! Use dataframe and series objects from popular libraries like Dask, Modin, Numpy, pandas, Polars, PyArrow, Snowpark, Xarray, and more. Use database cursors compliant with the Python Database API Specification 2.0. Use anything that supports the Python dataframe interchange protocol. See the [docs](/develop/api-reference/data/st.dataframe).

**Notable Changes**

- ↔️ You can control the initial expansion state of [`st.json`](/develop/api-reference/data/st.json) elements.
- 🧑‍💻 You can choose to wrap lines in [`st.code`](/develop/api-reference/text/st.code).
- 🕵️ Streamlit supports Kubernetes style secrets so you can use Snowflake Snowpark Container Services secret format ([#9078](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9078)).
- ⤴️ Breaking change: We removed a patch that allows custom validators in `pydantic<2.0` ([#9257](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9257)).
- 💔 Breaking change: We removed the experimental cache replay feature from caching decorators ([#9305](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9305)).

**Other Changes**

- 🌐 For better app efficiency, a WebSocket reconnect will not trigger a rerun unless a script run was interrupted ([#9083](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9083)).
- 👋 We updated our `streamlit hello` app to use Google Material icons.
- ⌨️ `st.number_input`, `st.selectbox`, `st.slider`, `st.select_slider`, and [`st.radio`](http://st.radio) provide more precise type hinting for their return values ([#9048](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9048), [#9296](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9296), [#8717](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8717)). Thanks, [Asaurus1](https://github.com/Asaurus1)!
- ⭐ [`st.feedback`](http://st.feedback) provides more precise type hinting for its return value ([#9216](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9216)). Thanks, [wyattscarpenter](https://github.com/wyattscarpenter)!

- 💩 Bug fix: Elements unstale within a fragment rerun as they are updated instead of all together at the end of the fragment rerun ([#9285](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9285)).
- 🪱 Bug fix: If a block type changes during a rerun, Streamlit discards the child elements of that block to prevent improper visual artifacts, like `st.tabs` causing a blank page ([#9276](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9276), [#9259](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9259), [#8676](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8676)).

- 🐞 Bug fix: We stabilized the identity of [`st.map`](http://st.map) instances so the command doesn't create multiple maps when its parameters are updated ([#9092](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9092), [#8329](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8329)).
