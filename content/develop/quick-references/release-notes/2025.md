# 2025 release notes

This page contains release notes for Streamlit versions released in 2025. For the latest version of Streamlit, see [Release notes](/develop/quick-reference/release-notes).

## **Version 1.50.0**

_Release date: September 23, 2025_

**Highlights**

- 🤹 Introducing [`MultiselectColumn`](/develop/api-reference/data/st.column_config/st.column_config.multiselectcolumn) to configure colorful, editable lists in your dataframes.
- 🎨 Announcing [color palette](/develop/concepts/configuration/theming-customize-colors-and-borders#basic-color-palette) configuration options to set the exact shade of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, and grey to use in Markdown, status elements, sparklines, `st.metric`, and `st.badge`.
- 📊 [`st.bar_chart`](/develop/api-reference/charts/st.bar_chart) has a new `sort` parameter for conveniently sorting your bars.

**Notable Changes**

- 🔑 To prevent widgets from resetting when you change a parameter, widgets are transitioning to an identity based only on their keys (if provided). The following widgets use only their key for their identity:
  - `st.button`
  - `st.download_button`
  - `st.checkbox`
  - `st.toggle`
  - `st.text_area`
  - `st.text_input`
  - `st.number_input`
  - `st.time_input`
  - `st.date_input`
  - `st.selectbox`
  - `st.multiselect`

Thanks, [zyfy29](https://github.com/zyfy29)!

- 🔲 You can configure [`st.table`](/develop/api-reference/data/st.table) borders to show all, only horizontal, or no lines.
- 📂 You can specify a default tab in [`st.tabs`](/develop/api-reference/layout/st.tabs).
