- 🧠 We've modified session state to reset widgets if any of their arguments changed even if they provide a key.

**Other Changes**

- 🐞 Bug fixes: Support svgs from a URL ([#3809](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/3809)) and that do not start with `<svg>` tag ([#3789](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/3789)).

**Notable Changes**

- 📱 When using `st.columns`, columns will stack vertically when viewport size \<640px so that column layout on smaller viewports is consistent and cleaner. ([#3594](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3594)).
