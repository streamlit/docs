- 👮 Introducing [`st.badge`](/develop/api-reference/text/st.badge) to insert a colored badge element. You can also include badges in Markdown using a new directive.
- 🏗️ Use [`streamlit init`](/develop/api-reference/cli/init) in your terminal to create all the local files you need for a new Streamlit app.

**Notable Changes**

- 🤖 [`st.exception`](/develop/api-reference/status/st.exception) includes links to open Google or ChatGPT with the contents of the exception. This includes uncaught exceptions displayed in the app.
- 🗺️ You can access the user's locale through [`st.context`](/develop/api-reference/caching-and-state/st.context#contextlocale) ([#10563](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/10563)).
