  Thanks [@tanmaylaud](https://github.com/tanmaylaud)!

## Version 0.63.0

_Release date: July 13, 2020_

**Highlights:**

- 🧩 **Support for Streamlit Components!!!** See
  [documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/streamlit_components.html) for more info.
- 🕗 Support for datetimes in
  [`st.slider`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#streamlit.slider). And, of course, just

## Version 0.62.0

_Release date: June 21, 2020_

**Highlights:**

- 📨 Ability to turn websocket compression on/off via the config option
  `server.enableWebsocketCompression`. This is useful if your server strips HTTP headers and you do
  not have access to change that behavior.
- 🗝️ Out-of-the-box support for CSRF protection using the
  [Cookie-to-header token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery#Cookie-to-header_token)
  technique. This means that if you're serving your Streamlit app from multiple replicas you'll need
  to configure them to to use the same cookie secret with the `server.cookieSecret` config option.
  To turn XSRF protection off, set `server.enableXsrfProtection=false`.

**Notable bug fixes:**

- 🖼️ Added a grace period to the image cache expiration logic in order to fix multiple related bugs
  where images sent with `st.image` or `st.pyplot` were sometimes missing.

## Version 0.61.0

_Release date: June 2, 2020_

**Highlights:**

- 📅 Support for date ranges in `st.date_picker`. See
  [docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#streamlit.date_picker)
  for more info, but the TLDR is: just pass a list/tuple as the default date and it will be
  interpreted as a range.
- 🗣️ You can now choose whether `st.echo` prints the code above or below the output of the echoed
  block. To learn more, refer to the `code_location` argument in the
  [docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#streamlit.echo).
- 📦 Improved `@st.cache` support for Keras models and Tensorflow `saved_models`.

## Version 0.60.0

_Release date: May 18, 2020_

**Highlights:**

- ↕️ Ability to set the height of an `st.text_area` with the `height` argument
  (expressed in pixels). See
  [docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#streamlit.text_area) for more.
- 🔡 Ability to set the maximimum number of characters allowed in `st.text_area`
  or `st.text_input`. Check out the `max_chars` argument in the
  [docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#streamlit.text_area).
- 🗺️ Better DeckGL support for the [H3](https://h3geo.org/) geospatial indexing
  system. So now you can use things like `H3HexagonLayer` in
  [`st.pydeck_chart`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#streamlit.pydeck_chart).
- 📦 Improved `@st.cache` support for PyTorch TensorBase and Model.

## Version 0.59.0

_Release date: May 05, 2020_

**Highlights:**

- 🎨 New color-picker widget! Use it with
  [`st.beta_color_picker()`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/0.69.0/api.html#streamlit.beta_color_picker)
- 🧪 Introducing `st.beta_*` and `st.experimental_*` function prefixes, for faster
  Streamlit feature releases. See
  [docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#pre-release-features) for more info.
- 📦 Improved `@st.cache` support for SQL Alchemy objects, CompiledFFI, PyTorch
  Tensors, and `builtins.mappingproxy`.

## Version 0.58.0

_Release date: April 22, 2020_

**Highlights:**

- 💼 Made `st.selectbox` filtering case-insensitive.
- ㈬ Better support for Tensorflow sessions in `@st.cache`.
- 📊 Changed behavior of `st.pyplot` to auto-clear the figure only when using
  the global Matplotlib figure (i.e. only when calling `st.pyplot()` rather
  than `st.pyplot(fig)`).

## Version 0.57.0

_Release date: March 26, 2020_

**Highlights:**

- ⏲️ Ability to set expiration options for `@st.cache`'ed functions by setting
  the `max_entries` and `ttl` arguments. See
  [docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#streamlit.cache).
- 🆙 Improved the machinery behind `st.file_uploader`, so it's much more
  performant now! Also increased the default upload limit to 200MB
  (configurable via `server.max_upload_size`).
- 🔒 The `server.address` config option now _binds_ the server to that address
  for added security.
- 📄 Even more details added to error messages for `@st.cache` for easier
  debugging.

## Version 0.56.0

_Release date: February 15, 2020_

**Highlights:**

- 📄 Improved error messages for st.cache. The errors now also point to the new
  caching docs we just released. Read more
  [here](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/help-us-stress-test-streamlit-s-latest-caching-update/1944)!

**Breaking changes:**

- 🐍 As [announced last month](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/streamlit-will-deprecate-python-2-in-february/1656),
  **Streamlit no longer supports Python 2.** To use Streamlit you'll need
  Python 3.5 or above.

## Version 0.55.0

_Release date: February 4, 2020_

**Highlights:**

- 📺 **Ability to record screencasts directly from Streamlit!** This allows
  you to easily record and share explanations about your models, analyses,
  data, etc. Just click ☰ then "Record a screencast". Give it a try!

## Version 0.54.0

_Release date: January 29, 2020_

**Highlights:**

- ⌨️ Support for password fields! Just pass `type="password"` to
  `st.text_input()`.

**Notable fixes:**

- ✳️ Numerous st.cache improvements, including better support for complex objects.
- 🗣️ Fixed cross-talk in sidebar between multiple users.

**Breaking changes:**

- If you're using the SessionState <del>hack</del> Gist, you should re-download it!
  Depending on which hack you're using, here are some links to save you some
  time:
  - [SessionState.py](https://gist.github.com/tvst/036da038ab3e999a64497f42de966a92)
  - [st_state_patch.py](https://gist.github.com/tvst/0899a5cdc9f0467f7622750896e6bd7f)

## Version 0.53.0

_Release date: January 14, 2020_

**Highlights:**

- 🗺️ Support for all DeckGL features! Just use
  [Pydeck](https://deckgl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) instead of
  [`st.deck_gl_chart`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#streamlit.pydeck_chart).
  To do that, simply pass a PyDeck object to
  [`st.pydeck_chart`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#streamlit.pydeck_chart),
  [`st.write`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#streamlit.write),
  or [magic](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#magic).

  _Note that as a **preview release** things may change in the near future.
  Looking forward to hearing input from the community before we stabilize the
  API!_

  **The goals is for this to replace `st.deck_gl_chart`,** since it
  is does everything the old API did _and much more!_

- 🆕 Better handling of Streamlit upgrades while developing. We now auto-reload
  the browser tab if the app it is displaying uses a newer version of Streamlit
  than the one the tab is running.

- 👑 New favicon, with our new logo!

**Notable fixes:**

- Magic now works correctly in Python 3.8. It no longer causes
  docstrings to render in your app.

**Breaking changes:**

- Updated how we calculate the default width and height of all chart types.
  We now leave chart sizing up to your charting library itself, so please refer
  to the library's documentation.

  As a result, the `width` and `height` arguments have been deprecated
  from most chart commands, and `use_container_width` has been introduced
  everywhere to allow you to make charts fill as much horizontal space as
  possible (this used to be the default).
