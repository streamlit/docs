## Advanced features

This section gives you background on how different parts of Streamlit work.

##### Theming

This section provides examples of how Streamlit page elements are affected by the various theme config options.

- [primaryColor](/library/advanced-features/theming#primarycolor)
- [backgroundcolor](/library/advanced-features/theming#backgroundcolor)
- [secondarybackgroundcolor](/library/advanced-features/theming#secondarybackgroundcolor)
- [textcolor](/library/advanced-features/theming#textcolor)
- [font](/library/advanced-features/theming#font)
- [base](/library/advanced-features/theming#base)

##### Streamlit configuration

When you install Streamlit, a command-line (CLI) tool gets installed as well. The purpose of this tool is to run Streamlit apps, change Streamlit configuration options, and help you diagnose and fix issues.

- [What is the command-line interface (CLI)?](/library/advanced-features/configuration#command-line-interface)
- [How to run Streamlit apps from the CLI?](/library/advanced-features/configuration#run-streamlit-apps)

<RefCard href="/library/advanced-features/caching" size="half">

##### Optimize performance with `st.cache`

Streamlit provides a caching mechanism that allows your app to stay performant even when loading data from the web, manipulating large datasets, or performing expensive computations. This is done with the [**`@st.cache`**](/library/api-reference/performance/st.cache) decorator.

- [Caching when the function arguments change?](/library/advanced-features/caching#example-1-basic-usage)
- [Caching when the function body changes](/library/advanced-features/caching#example-3-when-the-function-body-changes)
- [Caching when an inner function changes](/library/advanced-features/caching#example-4-when-an-inner-function-changes)

<RefCard href="/library/advanced-features/experimental-cache-primitives" size="half">

##### Experimental cache primitives

Streamlit provides two experimental primitives to memoize function executions and store singleton objects.

[**`@st.experimental_memo`**](/library/api-reference/performance/st.experimental_memo) is used to store expensive computation which can be "cached" or "memoized" in the traditional sense.

[**`@st.experimental_singleton`**](/library/api-reference/performance/st.experimental_singleton) is a key-value store that's shared across all sessions of a Streamlit app. It's great for storing heavyweight singleton objects across sessions (like TensorFlow/Torch/Keras sessions and/or database connections).

##### Add statefulness to apps

Session State is a way to share variables between reruns, for each user session. In addition to the ability to store and persist state, Streamlit also exposes the ability to manipulate state using Callbacks.

- [How to use `args` and `kwargs` in callbacks?](/library/advanced-features/session-state#example-3-use-args-and-kwargs-in-callbacks)
- [How to use callbacks in forms?](/library/advanced-features/session-state#example-4-forms-and-callbacks)

##### Advanced notes on widget behavior

Widgets are magical and often work how you want. But they can have surprising behavior in some situations. This section provides is a high-level, abstract description of widget behavior, including some common edge-cases.
