##### Caching

The Streamlit cache allows your app to stay performant even when loading data from the web, manipulating large datasets, or performing expensive computations. To cache a function in Streamlit, you need to decorate it with one of two decorators: `st.cache_data` and `st.cache_resource`.

- [Basic usage](/library/advanced-features/caching#basic-usage)
  - [st.cache_data](/library/advanced-features/caching#stcache_data)
