# Streamlit configuration

## Command-line interface

When you install Streamlit, a command-line (CLI) tool gets installed
as well. The purpose of this tool is to run Streamlit apps, change Streamlit configuration options,
and help you diagnose and fix issues.

To see all of the supported commands:

```bash
streamlit --help
```

### Run Streamlit apps

```bash
streamlit run your_script.py [-- script args]
```

Runs your app. At any time you can stop the server with **Ctrl+c**.

<Note>

When passing your script some custom arguments, **they must be passed after
two dashes**. Otherwise the arguments get interpreted as arguments to Streamlit
itself.

</Note>

To see the Streamlit 'Hello, World!' example app, run `streamlit hello`.

### View documentation

```bash
streamlit docs
```

Opens the Streamlit documentation (i.e. this website) in a web browser.

### Clear cache

```bash
streamlit cache clear
```

Clears persisted files from the on-disk [Streamlit
cache](/library/api-reference/performance), if present.

## Set configuration options

Streamlit provides four different ways to set configuration options:

1. In a **global config file** at `~/.streamlit/config.toml` for macOS/Linux or `%userprofile%/.streamlit/config.toml` for Windows:

   ```toml
   [server]
   port = 80
   ```

2. In a **per-project config file** at `$CWD/.streamlit/config.toml`, where
   `$CWD` is the folder you're running Streamlit from.

3. Through `STREAMLIT_*` **environment variables**, such as:

   ```bash
   export STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT=80
   ```

4. As **flags on the command line** when running `streamlit run`. These allow you
   to do things like change the port the app is served from, disable run-on-save, and
   more:

   ```bash
   streamlit run your_script.py --server.port 80
   ```

## View all configuration options

```bash
streamlit config show
```

Shows all config options available for Streamlit, including their current
values:

```toml
# last updated 2021-09-21

[global]

# By default, Streamlit checks if the Python watchdog module is available and, if not, prints a warning asking for you to install it. The watchdog module is not required, but highly recommended. It improves Streamlit's ability to detect changes to files in your filesystem.
# If you'd like to turn off this warning, set this to True.
# Default: false
disableWatchdogWarning = false

# If True, will show a warning when you run a Streamlit-enabled script via "python my_script.py".
# Default: true
showWarningOnDirectExecution = true

# DataFrame serialization.
# Acceptable values:
# - 'legacy': Serialize DataFrames using Streamlit's custom format. Slow but battle-tested.
# - 'arrow': Serialize DataFrames using Apache Arrow. Much faster and versatile.
# Default: 'arrow'
dataFrameSerialization = "arrow"

[logger]

# Level of logging: 'error', 'warning', 'info', or 'debug'.
# Default: 'info'
level = "debug"

# String format for logging messages. If logger.datetimeFormat is set, logger messages will default to `%(asctime)s.%(msecs)03d %(message)s`. See [Python's documentation](https://docs.python.org/2.6/library/logging.html#formatter-objects) for available attributes.
# Default: None
messageFormat = "%(asctime)s %(levelname) -7s %(name)s: %(message)s"

[client]

# Whether to enable st.cache.
# Default: true
caching = true

# If false, makes your Streamlit script not draw to a Streamlit app.
# Default: true
displayEnabled = true

# Controls whether uncaught app exceptions are displayed in the browser. By default, this is set to True and Streamlit displays app exceptions and associated tracebacks in the browser.
# If set to False, an exception will result in a generic message being shown in the browser, and exceptions and tracebacks will be printed to the console only.
# Default: true
showErrorDetails = true

[runner]

# Allows you to type a variable or string by itself in a single line of Python code to write it to the app.
# Default: true
magicEnabled = true

# Install a Python tracer to allow you to stop or pause your script at any point and introspect it. As a side-effect, this slows down your script's execution.
# Default: false
installTracer = false

# Sets the MPLBACKEND environment variable to Agg inside Streamlit to prevent Python crashing.
# Default: true
fixMatplotlib = true

# Run the Python Garbage Collector after each script execution. This can help avoid excess memory use in Streamlit apps, but could introduce delay in rerunning the app script for high-memory-use applications.
# Default: true
postScriptGC = true

[server]

# List of folders that should not be watched for changes. This impacts both "Run on Save" and @st.cache.
# Relative paths will be taken as relative to the current working directory.

# Default: []
folderWatchBlacklist = []

# Change the type of file watcher used by Streamlit, or turn it off completely.
# Allowed values: * "auto" : Streamlit will attempt to use the watchdog module, and falls back to polling if watchdog is not available. * "watchdog" : Force Streamlit to use the watchdog module. * "poll" : Force Streamlit to always use polling. * "none" : Streamlit will not watch files.
# Default: "auto"

# Automatically rerun script when the file is modified on disk.
# Default: false
