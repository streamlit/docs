# Using forms

When you don't want to rerun your script with each input made by a user, `st.form` is here to help! Forms make it easy to batch user input into a single rerun. This guide to using forms provides examples and explains how users interact with forms.

## Example

In the following example, a user can set multiple parameters to update the map. As the user changes the parameters, the script will not rerun and the map will not update. When the user submits the form with the button labeled "**Update map**", the script reruns and the map updates.

If at any time the user clicks "**Generate new points**" which is outside of the form, the script will rerun. If the user has any unsubmitted changes within the form, these will _not_ be sent with the rerun. All changes made to a form will only be sent to the Python backend when the form itself is submitted.

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def get_data():
    df = pd.DataFrame({
        "lat": np.random.randn(200) / 50 + 37.76,
        "lon": np.random.randn(200) / 50 + -122.4,
        "team": ['A','B']*100
    })
    return df

if st.button('Generate new points'):
    st.session_state.df = get_data()
if 'df' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.df = get_data()
df = st.session_state.df

with st.form("my_form"):
    header = st.columns([1,2,2])
    header[0].subheader('Color')
    header[1].subheader('Opacity')
    header[2].subheader('Size')

    row1 = st.columns([1,2,2])
    colorA = row1[0].color_picker('Team A', '#0000FF')
    opacityA = row1[1].slider('A opacity', 20, 100, 50, label_visibility='hidden')
    sizeA = row1[2].slider('A size', 50, 200, 100, step=10, label_visibility='hidden')

    row2 = st.columns([1,2,2])
    colorB = row2[0].color_picker('Team B', '#FF0000')
    opacityB = row2[1].slider('B opacity', 20, 100, 50, label_visibility='hidden')
    sizeB = row2[2].slider('B size', 50, 200, 100, step=10, label_visibility='hidden')

    st.form_submit_button('Update map')

alphaA = int(opacityA*255/100)
alphaB = int(opacityB*255/100)

df['color'] = np.where(df.team=='A',colorA+f'{alphaA:02x}',colorB+f'{alphaB:02x}')
df['size'] = np.where(df.team=='A',sizeA, sizeB)

st.map(df, size='size', color='color')

## User interaction

If a widget is not in a form, that widget will trigger a script rerun whenever a user changes its value. For widgets with keyed input (`st.number_input`, `st.text_input`, `st.text_area`), a new value triggers a rerun when the user clicks or tabs out of the widget. A user can also submit a change by pressing `Enter` while thier cursor is active in the widget.

On the other hand if a widget is inside of a form, the script will not rerun when a user clicks or tabs out of that widget. For widgets inside a form, the script will rerun when the form is submitted. When the form is submitted, all widgets within the form will send their updated values to the Python backend.

![Forms](/images/forms.gif)

A user can submit a form using **Enter** on their keyboard if their cursor active in a widget that accepts keyed input. Within `st.number_input` and `st.text_input` a user presses **Enter** to submit the form. Within `st.text_area` a user presses **Ctrl+Enter**/**âŒ˜+Enter** to submit the form.

## Widget values

Before a form is submitted, all widgets within that form will have default values, just like widgets outside of a form have default values.

```python
import streamlit as st

with st.form("my_form"):
   st.write("Inside the form")
   my_number = st.slider('Pick a number', 1, 10)
   my_color = st.selectbox('Pick a color', ['red','orange','green','blue','violet'])
   st.form_submit_button('Submit my picks')

# This is outside the form
st.write(my_number)
st.write(my_color)
```

## Forms are containers

When `st.form` is called, a container is created on the frontend. You can write to that container like you do with other [container elements](http://localhost:3000/library/api-reference/layout). You can use Python's `with` statement as shown in the example above, or you can assign the form container to a variable and call methods on it directly. You can also place `st.form_submit_button` anywhere in the form container: first, last, or someplace in-between.

```python
import streamlit as st

animal = st.form('my_animal')

# This is writing directly to the main body. Since the form container is
# defined above, this will appear below everything written in the form.
sound = st.selectbox('Sounds like', ['meow','woof','squeak','tweet'])

# These methods called on the form container, so they appear inside the form.
submit = animal.form_submit_button(f'Say it with {sound}!')
sentence = animal.text_input('Your sentence:', 'Where\'s the tuna?')
say_it = sentence.rstrip('.,!?') + f', {sound}!'
if submit:
    animal.subheader(say_it)
```

## Advanced

The purpose of a form is to override the default behavior of Streamlit which reruns a script as soon as the user makes a change. For widgets outside of a form, the logical is:

1. The user changes a widget's value on the frontend.
2. The widget's value in `st.session_state` and in the Python backend (server) is updated.
3. The script rerun begins. 
4. If the widget has a callback, it is executed as a prefix to the page rerun.
5. When the updated widget's function is executed during the rerun, it outputs the new value.

For widgets inside a form, any changes made by a user (step 1) do not get passed to the Python backend (step 2) until they submit the form. Furthermore, the only widget inside a form that can have a callback is `st.form_submit_button`. If you need to run a process from newly submitted form values, you have three major patterns.

### Execute the logic after the form

If you need to run a one-time process as a result of a form submission, you can condition that process on the `st.form_submit_button` and execute it after the form. If you need results to display before the form, you can use containers to control where the form displays relative to your output.

```python

col1,col2 = st.columns(2)
col1.write('Sum:')

with st.form('addition'):
    a = st.number_input('a')
    b = st.number_input('b')
    submit = st.form_submit_button('add')

if submit:
    col2.write(str(a+b))
```



### Use a callback with session state

### Use `st.experimental_rerun`

## Limitations

* An `st.form` cannot be embedded inside another `st.form`.
* Every form must have an associated `st.form_submit_button`.
* By definition, `st.button` does not make much sense within a form. Forms are all about batching widget state together, but buttons are inherently stateless. So declaring an st.button inside a form will lead to an error.
* Also by definition, interdependent widgets within a form are unlikely to be particularly useful. If you pass `widget1`'s value into `widget2` when they are both inside a form, then `widget2` will only update when the form is submitted.
* Callback functions can only be assigned to `st.form_submit_button` within a form; no other widgets in a form can have a callback.
