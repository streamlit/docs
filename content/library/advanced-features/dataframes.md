# Dataframes

Dataframes are a great way to display and edit data in a tabular format. Working with Pandas DataFrames and other tabular data structures is key to data science workflows. If developers and data scientists want to display this data in Streamlit, they have multiple options: `st.dataframe` and `st.data_editor`. If you want to solely display data in a table-like UI, [st.dataframe](/develop/api-reference/data/st.dataframe) is the way to go. If you want to interactively edit data, use [st.data_editor](/develop/api-reference/data/st.data_editor). We explore the use cases and advantages of each option in the following sections.

## Display dataframes with st.dataframe

Streamlit can display dataframes in a table-like UI via `st.dataframe` :

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(
    [
        {"command": "st.selectbox", "rating": 4, "is_widget": True},
        {"command": "st.balloons", "rating": 5, "is_widget": False},
        {"command": "st.time_input", "rating": 3, "is_widget": True},
    ]
)

st.dataframe(df, use_container_width=True)
```

## `st.dataframe` UI features

`st.dataframe` provides additional functionality by using [glide-data-grid](https://github.com/glideapps/glide-data-grid) under the hood:

- **Column sorting**: Sort columns by clicking on their headers.
- **Column resizing**: Resize columns by dragging and dropping column header borders.
- **Table resizing**: Resize tables by dragging and dropping the bottom right corner.
- **Fullscreen view**: Enlarge tables to fullscreen by clicking the fullscreen icon (<i style={{ verticalAlign: "-.25em" }} className={{ class: "material-icons-sharp" }}>fullscreen</i>) in the toolbar.
- **Search**: Click the search icon (<i style={{ verticalAlign: "-.25em" }} className={{ class: "material-icons-sharp" }}>search</i>) in the toolbar or use hotkeys (`âŒ˜+F`Â orÂ `Ctrl+F`) to search through the data.
- **Download**: Click the download icon in the toolbar to download the data as a CSV file.
- **Copy to clipboard**: Select one or multiple cells, copy them to the clipboard (`âŒ˜+C`Â orÂ `Ctrl+C`), and paste them into your favorite spreadsheet software.

Try out all the UI features using the embedded app from the prior section.

In addition to Pandas DataFrames, `st.dataframe` also supports other common Python types, e.g., list, dict, or numpy array. It also supports [Snowpark](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/index) and [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/) DataFrames, which allow you to lazily evaluate and pull data from databases. This can be useful for working with large datasets.

## Edit data with st.data_editor

Streamlit supports editable dataframes via the `st.data_editor` command. Check out its API in [st.data_editor](/develop/api-reference/data/st.data_editor). It shows the dataframe in a table, similar to `st.dataframe`. But in contrast to `st.dataframe`, this table isn't static! The user can click on cells and edit them. The edited data is then returned on the Python side. Here's an example:

```python
df = pd.DataFrame(
    [
        {"command": "st.selectbox", "rating": 4, "is_widget": True},
        {"command": "st.balloons", "rating": 5, "is_widget": False},
        {"command": "st.time_input", "rating": 3, "is_widget": True},
    ]
)

df = load_data()
edited_df = st.data_editor(df) # ðŸ‘ˆ An editable dataframe

favorite_command = edited_df.loc[edited_df["rating"].idxmax()]["command"]
st.markdown(f"Your favorite command is **{favorite_command}** ðŸŽˆ")
```

<Cloud src="https://doc-data-editor.streamlit.app/?embed=true" height="300px"/>

Try it out by double-clicking on any cell. You'll notice you can edit all cell values. Try editing the values in the rating column and observe how the text output at the bottom changes:

## `st.data_editor` UI features

`st.data_editor` also supports a few additional things:

- [**Add and delete rows**](#add-and-delete-rows): You can do this by setting `num_rows= "dynamic"` when calling `st.data_editor`. This will allow users to add and delete rows as needed.
- [**Copy and paste support**](#copy-and-paste-support): Copy and paste both between `st.data_editor` and spreadsheet software like Google Sheets and Excel.
- [**Access edited data**](#access-edited-data): Access only the individual edits instead of the entire edited data structure via Session State.
- [**Bulk edits**](#bulk-edits): Similar to Excel, just drag a handle to edit neighboring cells.
- [**Automatic input validation**](#automatic-input-validation): Column Configuration provides strong data type support and other configurable options. For example, there's no way to enter letters into a number cell. Number cells can have a designated min and max.
- [**Edit common data structures**](#edit-common-data-structures): `st.data_editor` supports lists, dicts, NumPy ndarray, and more!

### Add and delete rows

With `st.data_editor`, viewers can add or delete rows via the table UI. This mode can be activated by setting theÂ `num_rows` parameter toÂ `"dynamic"`:

```python
edited_df = st.data_editor(df, num_rows="dynamic")
```

- To add new rows, click the plus icon (<i style={{ verticalAlign: "-.25em" }} className={{ class: "material-icons-sharp" }}>add</i>) in the toolbar. Alternatively, click inside a shaded cell below the bottom row of the table.
- To delete rows, select one or more rows using the checkboxes on the left. Click the delete icon (<i style={{ verticalAlign: "-.25em" }} className={{ class: "material-icons-sharp" }}>delete</i>) or press the `delete` key on your keyboard.

<Cloud src="https://doc-data-editor-clipboard.streamlit.app/?embed=true" height="400px"/>

### Copy and paste support

The data editor supports pasting in tabular data from Google Sheets, Excel, Notion, and many other similar tools. You can also copy-paste data betweenÂ `st.data_editor` instances. This functionality, powered by the [Clipboard API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard_API), can be a huge time saver for users who need to work with data across multiple platforms. To try it out:

1. Copy data fromÂ [this Google Sheets document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z0zd-5dF_HfqUaDDq4BWAOnsdlGCjkbTNwDZMBQ1dOY/edit?usp=sharing)Â to your clipboard.
2. Single click any cell in theÂ `name`Â column in the app above. Paste it in using hotkeys (`âŒ˜+V`Â orÂ `Ctrl+V`).

<Note>

Every cell of the pasted data will be evaluated individually and inserted into the cells if the data is compatible with the column type. For example, pasting in non-numerical text data into a number column will be ignored.

</Note>

<Tip>

If you embed your apps with iframes, you'll need to allow the iframe to access the clipboard if you want to use the copy-paste functionality. To do so, give the iframe [`clipboard-write`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard/write) and [`clipboard-read`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard/read) permissions. E.g.

```javascript
<iframe allow="clipboard-write;clipboard-read;" ... src="https://your-app-url"></iframe>
```

As developers, ensure the app is served with a valid, trusted certificate when using TLS. If users encounter issues with copying and pasting data, direct them to check if their browser has activated clipboard access permissions for the Streamlit application, either when prompted or through the browser's site settings.

</Tip>

### Access edited data

Sometimes, it is more convenient to know which cells have been changed rather than getting the entire edited dataframe back. Streamlit makes this easy through the use of [Session State](/develop/concepts/architecture/session-state). If a `key` parameter is set, Streamlit will store any changes made to the dataframe in Session State.

This snippet shows how you can access changed data using Session State:

```python
st.data_editor(df, key="my_key", num_rows="dynamic") # ðŸ‘ˆ Set a key
st.write("Here's the value in Session State:")
st.write(st.session_state["my_key"]) # ðŸ‘ˆ Show the value in Session State
```

In this code snippet, the `key` parameter is set to `"my_key"`. After the data editor is created, the value associated to `"my_key"` in Session State is displayed in the app using `st.write`. This shows the additions, edits, and deletions that were made.

This can be useful when working with large dataframes and you only need to know which cells have changed, rather than access the entire edited dataframe.

<Cloud src="https://doc-data-editor-changed.streamlit.app/?embed=true" height="700px"/>

Use all we've learned so far and apply them to the above embedded app. Try editing cells, adding new rows, and deleting rows.

Notice how edits to the table are reflected in Session State. When you make any edits, a rerun is triggered which sends the edits to the backend. The widget's state is a JSON object containing three properties: **edited_rows**, **added_rows**, and **deleted rows:**.

<Warning>

When going from `st.experimental_data_editor` to `st.data_editor` in 1.23.0, the data editor's representation in `st.session_state` was changed. The `edited_cells` dictionary is now called `edited_rows` and uses a different format (`{0: {"column name": "edited value"}}` instead of `{"0:1": "edited value"}`). You may need to adjust your code if your app uses `st.experimental_data_editor` in combination with `st.session_state`."

</Warning>

- `edited_rows` is a dictionary containing all edits. Keys are zero-based row indices and values are dictionaries that map column names to edits (e.g. `{0: {"col1": ..., "col2": ...}}`).
- `added_rows` is a list of newly added rows. Each value is a dictionary with the same format as above (e.g. `[{"col1": ..., "col2": ...}]`).
- `deleted_rows` is a list of row numbers that have been deleted from the table (e.g. `[0, 2]`).

`st.data_editor` does not support reordering rows, so added rows will always be appended to the end of the dataframe with any edits and deletions applicable to the original rows.

### Bulk edits

The data editor includes a feature that allows for bulk editing of cells. Similar to Excel, you can drag a handle across a selection of cells to edit their values in bulk. You can even apply commonly used [keyboard shortcuts](https://github.com/glideapps/glide-data-grid/blob/main/packages/core/API.md#keybindings) in spreadsheet software. This is useful when you need to make the same change across multiple cells, rather than editing each cell individually.

### Edit common data structures

Editing doesn't just work for Pandas DataFrames! You can also edit lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, NumPy arrays, or Snowpark & PySpark DataFrames. Most data types will be returned in their original format. But some types (e.g. Snowpark and PySpark) are converted to Pandas DataFrames. To learn about all the supported types, read the [st.data_editor](/develop/api-reference/data/st.data_editor) API.

For example, you can easily let the user add items to a list:

```python
edited_list = st.data_editor(["red", "green", "blue"], num_rows= "dynamic")
st.write("Here are all the colors you entered:")
st.write(edited_list)
```

Or numpy arrays:

```python
import numpy as np

st.data_editor(np.array([
	["st.text_area", "widget", 4.92],
	["st.markdown", "element", 47.22]
]))
```

Or lists of records:

```python
st.data_editor([
    {"name": "st.text_area", "type": "widget"},
    {"name": "st.markdown", "type": "element"},
])
```

Or dictionaries and many more types!

```python
st.data_editor({
	"st.text_area": "widget",
	"st.markdown": "element"
})
```

### Automatic input validation

The data editor includes automatic input validation to help prevent errors when editing cells. For example, if you have a column that contains numerical data, the input field will automatically restrict the user to only entering numerical data. This helps to prevent errors that could occur if the user were to accidentally enter a non-numerical value. Additional input validation can be configured through the [Column configuration API](/develop/api-reference/data/st.column_config). Keep reading below for an overview of column configuration, including validation options.

## Configuring columns

You can configure the display and editing behavior of columns in `st.dataframe` and `st.data_editor` via the [Column configuration API](/develop/api-reference/data/st.column_config). We have developed the API to let you add images, charts, and clickable URLs in dataframe and data editor columns. Additionally, you can make individual columns editable, set columns as categorical and specify which options they can take, hide the index of the dataframe, and much more.

Column configuration includes the following column types: Text, Number, Checkbox, Selectbox, Date, Time, Datetime, List, Link, Image, Line chart, Bar chart, and Progress. There is also a generic Column option. See the embedded app below to view these different column types. Each column type is individually previewed in the [Column configuration API](/develop/api-reference/data/st.column_config) documentation.

<Cloud src="https://doc-column-config-overview.streamlit.app/?embed=true&embed_options=disable_scrolling" height="480"/>

### Format values

A `format` parameter is available in column configuration for [Text](/develop/api-reference/data/st.column_config/st.column_config.textcolumn), [Date](/develop/api-reference/data/st.column_config/st.column_config.datecolumn), [Time](/develop/api-reference/data/st.column_config/st.column_config.timecolumn), and [Datetime](/develop/api-reference/data/st.column_config/st.column_config.datetimecolumn) columns. Chart-like columns can also be formatted. [Line chart](/develop/api-reference/data/st.column_config/st.column_config.linechartcolumn) and [Bar chart](/develop/api-reference/data/st.column_config/st.column_config.barchartcolumn) columns have a `y_min` and `y_max` parameters to set the vertical bounds. For a [Progress column](/develop/api-reference/data/st.column_config/st.column_config.progresscolumn), you can declare the horizontal bounds with `min_value` and `max_value`.

### Validate input

When specifying a column configuration, you can declare not only the data type of the column but also value restrictions. All column configuration elements allow you to make a column required with the keyword parameter `required=True`.

For Text and Link columns, you can specify the maximum number of characters with `max_chars` or use regular expressions to validate entries through `validate`. Numerical columns, including Number, Date, Time, and Datetime have `min_value` and `max_value` parameters. Selectbox columns have a configurable list of `options`.

The data type for Number columns is `float` by default. Passing a value of type `int` to any of `min_value`, `max_value`, `step`, or `default` will set the type for the column as `int`.

### Configure an empty dataframe

You can use `st.data_editor` to collect tabular input from a user. When starting from an empty dataframe, default column types are text. Use column configuration to specify the data types you want to collect from users.

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(columns=['name','age','color'])
colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'indigo', 'violet']
config = {
    'name' : st.column_config.TextColumn('Full Name (required)', width='large', required=True),
    'age' : st.column_config.NumberColumn('Age (years)', min_value=0, max_value=122),
    'color' : st.column_config.SelectboxColumn('Favorite Color', options=colors)
}

result = st.data_editor(df, column_config = config, num_rows='dynamic')

if st.button('Get results'):
    st.write(result)
```

<Cloud src="https://doc-column-config-empty.streamlit.app/?embed=true" height="300"/>

## Additional formatting options

In addition to column configuration, `st.dataframe` and `st.data_editor` have a few more parameters to customize the display of your dataframe.

- `hide_index` : Set to `True` to hide the dataframe's index.
- `column_order` : Pass a list of column labels to specify the order of display.
- `disabled` : Pass a list of column labels to disable them from editing. This let's you avoid disabling them individually.

## Handling large datasets

`st.dataframe` and `st.data_editor` have been designed to theoretically handle tables with millions of rows thanks to their highly performant implementation using the glide-data-grid library and HTML canvas. However, the maximum amount of data that an app can realistically handle will depend on several other factors, including:

1. The maximum size of WebSocket messages: Streamlit's WebSocket messages are configurable via the `server.maxMessageSize` [config option](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/configuration#view-all-configuration-options), which limits the amount of data that can be transferred via the WebSocket connection at once.
2. The server memory: The amount of data that your app can handle will also depend on the amount of memory available on your server. If the server's memory is exceeded, the app may become slow or unresponsive.
3. The user's browser memory: Since all the data needs to be transferred to the user's browser for rendering, the amount of memory available on the user's device can also affect the app's performance. If the browser's memory is exceeded, it may crash or become unresponsive.

In addition to these factors, a slow network connection can also significantly slow down apps that handle large datasets.

When handling large datasets with more than 150,000 rows, Streamlit applies additional optimizations and disables column sorting. This can help to reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed at once and improve the app's performance.

## Limitations

- Streamlit casts all column names to strings internally, so `st.data_editor` will return a DataFrame where all column names are strings.
- The dataframe toolbar is not currently configurable.
- While Streamlit's data editing capabilities offer a lot of functionality, editing is enabled for a limited set of column types ([TextColumn](/develop/api-reference/data/st.column_config/st.column_config.textcolumn), [NumberColumn](/develop/api-reference/data/st.column_config/st.column_config.numbercolumn), [LinkColumn](/develop/api-reference/data/st.column_config/st.column_config.linkcolumn), [CheckboxColumn](/develop/api-reference/data/st.column_config/st.column_config.checkboxcolumn), [SelectboxColumn](/develop/api-reference/data/st.column_config/st.column_config.selectboxcolumn), [DateColumn](/develop/api-reference/data/st.column_config/st.column_config.datecolumn), [TimeColumn](/develop/api-reference/data/st.column_config/st.column_config.timecolumn), and [DatetimeColumn](/develop/api-reference/data/st.column_config/st.column_config.datetimecolumn)). We are actively working on supporting editing for other column types as well, such as images, lists, and charts.
- Almost all editable datatypes are supported for index editing. However, `pandas.CategoricalIndex` and `pandas.MultiIndex` are not supported for editing.
- Sorting is not supported for `st.data_editor` when `num_rows="dynamic"`.
- Sorting is deactivated to optimize performance on large datasets with more than 150,000 rows.

We are continually working to improve Streamlit's handling of DataFrame and add functionality to data editing, so keep an eye out for updates.
