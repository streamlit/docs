- 🗝️ Out-of-the-box support for CSRF protection using the
  [Cookie-to-header token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery#Cookie-to-header_token)
  technique. This means that if you're serving your Streamlit app from multiple replicas you'll need

- 🔡 Ability to set the maximimum number of characters allowed in `st.text_area`
  or `st.text_input`. Check out the `max_chars` argument in the
  [docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#streamlit.text_area).
- 🗺️ Better DeckGL support for the [H3](https://h3geo.org/) geospatial indexing
  system. So now you can use things like `H3HexagonLayer` in
  [`st.pydeck_chart`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#streamlit.pydeck_chart).

_Release date: April 22, 2020_

**Highlights:**

- 💼 Made `st.selectbox` filtering case-insensitive.
- ㈬ Better support for Tensorflow sessions in `@st.cache`.
- 📊 Changed behavior of `st.pyplot` to auto-clear the figure only when using
  the global Matplotlib figure (i.e. only when calling `st.pyplot()` rather
  than `st.pyplot(fig)`).

## Version 0.57.0

_Release date: March 26, 2020_

**Highlights:**

- ⏲️ Ability to set expiration options for `@st.cache`'ed functions by setting
  the `max_entries` and `ttl` arguments. See
  [docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#streamlit.cache).
- 🆙 Improved the machinery behind `st.file_uploader`, so it's much more
  performant now! Also increased the default upload limit to 200MB
  (configurable via `server.max_upload_size`).
- 🔒 The `server.address` config option now _binds_ the server to that address
  for added security.

  Python 3.5 or above.

## Version 0.55.0

_Release date: February 4, 2020_

**Highlights:**

- 📺 **Ability to record screencasts directly from Streamlit!** This allows
  you to easily record and share explanations about your models, analyses,

## Version 0.54.0

_Release date: January 29, 2020_

**Highlights:**

- ⌨️ Support for password fields! Just pass `type="password"` to
  `st.text_input()`.

- 🗣️ Fixed cross-talk in sidebar between multiple users.

**Breaking changes:**

- If you're using the SessionState <del>hack</del> Gist, you should re-download it!
  Depending on which hack you're using, here are some links to save you some
  time:
  - [SessionState.py](https://gist.github.com/tvst/036da038ab3e999a64497f42de966a92)
  - [st_state_patch.py](https://gist.github.com/tvst/0899a5cdc9f0467f7622750896e6bd7f)

## Version 0.53.0

_Release date: January 14, 2020_

**Highlights:**

- 🗺️ Support for all DeckGL features! Just use
  [Pydeck](https://deckgl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) instead of
  [`st.deck_gl_chart`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#streamlit.pydeck_chart).
  To do that, simply pass a PyDeck object to
  [`st.pydeck_chart`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#streamlit.pydeck_chart),
  [`st.write`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#streamlit.write),
  or [magic](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#magic).

  _Note that as a **preview release** things may change in the near future.
  Looking forward to hearing input from the community before we stabilize the
  API!_

  **The goals is for this to replace `st.deck_gl_chart`,** since it
  is does everything the old API did _and much more!_

- 🆕 Better handling of Streamlit upgrades while developing. We now auto-reload
  the browser tab if the app it is displaying uses a newer version of Streamlit
  than the one the tab is running.

- 👑 New favicon, with our new logo!

**Notable fixes:**

- Magic now works correctly in Python 3.8. It no longer causes
  docstrings to render in your app.

**Breaking changes:**

- Updated how we calculate the default width and height of all chart types.
  We now leave chart sizing up to your charting library itself, so please refer
  to the library's documentation.

  As a result, the `width` and `height` arguments have been deprecated
  from most chart commands, and `use_container_width` has been introduced
  everywhere to allow you to make charts fill as much horizontal space as
  possible (this used to be the default).

## Version 0.52.0

_Release date: December 20, 2019_

**Highlights:**

- 📤 Preview release of the file uploader widget. To try it out just call
  [`st.file_uploader`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#streamlit.file_uploader)!

  _Note that as a **preview release** things may change in the near future.
  Looking forward to hearing input from the community before we stabilize the
  API!_

- 👋 Support for [emoji codes](https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/) in
  `st.write` and `st.markdown`! Try it out with `st.write("Hello :wave:")`.

**Breaking changes:**

- 🧹 `st.pyplot` now clears figures by default, since that's what you want 99% of
  the time. This allows you to create two or more Matplotlib charts without
  having to call
  [`pyplot.clf`](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.clf.html)
  every time. If you want to turn this behavior off, use
  [`st.pyplot(clear_figure=False)`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#streamlit.pyplot)
- 📣 `st.cache` no longer checks for input mutations. This is the first change
  of our ongoing effort to simplify the caching system and prepare Streamlit
  for the launch of other caching primitives like Session State!

## Version 0.51.0

_Release date: November 30, 2019_

**Highlights:**

- 🐕 You can now tweak the behavior of the file watcher with the config option `server.fileWatcherType`. Use it to switch between:
  - `auto` (default) : Streamlit will attempt to use the watchdog module, and
    falls back to polling if watchdog is not available.
  - `watchdog` : Force Streamlit to use the watchdog module.
  - `poll` : Force Streamlit to always use polling.
  - `none` : Streamlit will not watch files.

**Notable bug fixes:**

- Fix the "keyPrefix" option in static report sharing [#724](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/724)

- ↕️ You can now maximize charts and images!
- ⚡ Streamlit is now much faster when writing data in quick succession to your app.
- ✳️ Ability to blacklist folder globs from "run on save" and `@st.cache` hashing.
- 🎛️ Improved handling of widget state when Python file is modified.
- 🙈 Improved HTML support in `st.write` and `st.markdown`. HTML is still unsafe, though!

**Notable bug fixes:**

- Fixes `@st.cache` bug related to having your Python environment on current
  working directory. [Issue #242](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/242)
- Fixes loading of root url `/` on Windows. [Issue #244](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/244)

## Version 0.47.0

_Release date: October 1, 2019_

**Highlights:**

- 🌄 New hello.py showing off 4 glorious Streamlit apps. Try it out!
- 🔄 Streamlit now automatically selects an unused port when 8501 is already in use.
- 🎁 Sidebar support is now out of beta! Just start any command with `st.sidebar.` instead of `st.`
- ⚡ Performance improvements: we added a cache to our websocket layer so we no longer re-send data to the browser when it hasn't changed between runs
- 📈 Our "native" charts `st.line_chart`, `st.area_chart` and `st.bar_chart` now use Altair behind the scenes
- 🔫 Improved widgets: custom st.slider labels; default values in multiselect
- 🕵️‍♀️ The filesystem watcher now ignores hidden folders and virtual environments
- 💅 Plus lots of polish around caching and widget state management

**Breaking change:**

- 🛡️ We have temporarily disabled support for sharing static "snapshots" of Streamlit apps. Now that we're no longer in a limited-access beta, we need to make sure sharing is well thought through and abides by laws like the DMCA. But we're working on a solution!

## Version 0.46.0

_Release date: September 19, 2019_

**Highlights:**

- ✨ Magic commands! Use `st.write` without typing `st.write`. See
  https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#magic-commands
- 🎛️ New `st.multiselect` widget.
- 🐍 Fixed numerous install issues so now you can use `pip install streamlit`
  even in Conda! We've therefore deactivated our Conda repo.
- 🐞 Multiple bug fixes and additional polish in preparation for our launch!

**Breaking change:**

- 🛡️ HTML tags are now blacklisted in `st.write`/`st.markdown` by default. More
  information and a temporary work-around at:
  https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/152

**Highlights:**

- 📈 Greatly improved our support for named datasets in Vega-Lite and Altair
- 🙄 Added ability to ignore certain folders when watching for file changes. See the `server.folderWatchBlacklist` config option.
- ☔ More robust against syntax errors on the user's script and imported modules

## Version 0.40.0

_Release date: June 10, 2019_

**Highlights:**

- Streamlit is more than 10x faster. Just save and watch your analyses update instantly.
- We changed how you run Streamlit apps:
  `$ streamlit run your_script.py [script args]`
- Unlike the previous versions of Streamlit, `streamlit run [script] [script args]` creates a server (now you don't need to worry if the proxy is up). To kill the server, all you need to do is hit **Ctrl+c**.

**Why is this so much faster?**

Now, Streamlit keeps a single Python session running until you kill the server. This means that Streamlit can re-run your code without kicking off a new process; imported libraries are cached to memory. An added bonus is that `st.cache` now caches to memory instead of to disk.

**What happens if I run Streamlit the old way?**

If you run `$ python your_script.py` the script will execute from top to bottom, but won't produce a Streamlit app.

**What are the limitations of the new architecture?**

- To switch Streamlit apps, first you have to kill the Streamlit server with **Ctrl-c**. Then, you can use `streamlit run` to generate the next app.
- Streamlit only works when used inside Python files, not interactively from the Python REPL.

**What else do I need to know?**

- The strings we print to the command line when **liveSave** is on have been cleaned up. You may need to adjust any RegEx that depends on those.
- A number of config options have been renamed:

  | Old config | New config |
  | ---------- | ---------- |
  | proxy.isRemote | server.headless |
  | proxy.liveSave | server.liveSave |
  | proxy.runOnSave | server.runOnSave |
  | proxy.watchFileSystem | server.runOnSave |
  | proxy.enableCORS | server.enableCORS |
  | proxy.port | server.port |
  | browser.proxyAddress | browser.serverAddress |
  | browser.proxyPort | browser.serverPort |
  | client.waitForProxySecs | _n/a_ |
  | client.throttleSecs | _n/a_ |
  | client.tryToOutliveProxy | _n/a_ |
  | client.proxyAddress | _n/a_ |
  | client.proxyPort | _n/a_ |
  | proxy.autoCloseDelaySecs | _n/a_ |
  | proxy.reportExpirationSecs | _n/a_ |

**What if something breaks?**

If the new Streamlit isn't working, please let us know by Slack or email. You can downgrade at any time with these commands:

```bash
$ pip install --upgrade streamlit==0.37
```

```bash
$ conda install streamlit=0.37
```

**What's next?**

Thank you for staying with us on this journey! This version of Streamlit lays the foundation for interactive widgets, a new feature of Streamlit we're really excited to share with you in the next few months.
