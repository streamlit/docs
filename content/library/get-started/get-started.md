<!-- ## Share your app

After you’ve built a Streamlit app, it's time to share it! To show it off to the world you can use **Streamlit Cloud** to deploy, manage, and share your app for free. Streamlit Cloud is currently invitation only, so please [request an invite](https://streamlit.io/sharing-sign-up) and we'll get you one soon! -->

<!-- [[we'll need to grab the gif after the video editors are done with it on Wednesday]] -->

<!-- It works in 3 simple steps:

1. Put your app in a public Github repo (and make sure it has a requirements.txt!)
2. Sign into [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
3. Click 'Deploy an app' and then paste in your GitHub URL

That's it! **🎈**You now have a publicly deployed app that you can share with the world. Click to learn more about [how to use Streamlit Cloud](/streamlit-cloud/community). If you're looking for private sharing for your team, check out the [Team and Enterprise tiers](https://streamlit.io/cloud-sign-up).
