# Deployment concepts

Learn the fundamental concepts of app deployment. There are three main processes involved in deploying apps.

- Install Python, Streamlit, and other dependencies in your deployment environment.
- Securely handle your secrets and private information.
- Remote start your app (`streamlit run`).

If you're using Streamlit Community Cloud, we'll do most of the work for you!
