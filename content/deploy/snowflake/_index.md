There are three ways to host Streamlit apps in Snowflake.

        bold="Streamlit in Snowflake."

    >Run your Streamlit app as a native object in Snowflake. Enjoy an in-browser editor and minimal work to configure your environment. Share your app with other users in your Snowflake account through role-based access control. This is a great way to deploy apps internally for your business. Check out Snowflake docs!</InlineCallout>

        bold="Snowflake Native Apps."
        href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/native-apps/adding-streamlit"
    >Package your app with data and share it with other Snowflake accounts. This is a great way to share apps and their underlying data with other organizations who use Snowflake so they can run it in their own account. Check out Snowflake docs!</InlineCallout>
    <InlineCallout
        color="lightBlue-70"
        icon="web_asset"
        bold="Snowpark Container Services."
        href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/overview"
    >Deploy your app in a container that's optimized to run in Snowflake. This is the most flexible option where you can use any library. Share your app publicly or privately. Check out Snowflake docs!</InlineCallout>
</InlineCalloutContainer>

<Note>

    Using Snowpark Container Services to deploy a Streamlit app requires a compute pool, which is not available in a trial account at this time.
