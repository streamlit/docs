## Sign in with Google

1. Click "**Continue to sign-in**."
1. Click "**Continue with Google**."
1. Enter your Google account credentials and follow the prompts.

If your account is already linked to GitHub, you may be immediately prompted to sign in with GitHub.

## Sign in with GitHub

1. Click "**Continue to sign-in**."
1. Click "**Continue with GitHub**."
1. Enter your GitHub credentials and follow the prompts.

<Important>
    When you sign in with GitHub, Community Cloud will look for an account that uses the same email you have on your GitHub account. If such an account doesn't exist, Community Cloud will look for an account that uses your GitHub account for source control. In this latter instance, Community Cloud will update the email on your Community Cloud account to match the email on your GitHub account.
