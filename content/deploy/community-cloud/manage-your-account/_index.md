# Manage your account

You can [Update your email](/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-account/update-your-email) or completely [Delete your account](/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-account/delete-your-account) through [Workspace settings](/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-account/workspace-settings).
