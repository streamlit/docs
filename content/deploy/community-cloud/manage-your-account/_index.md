# Manage your account

You can [Update your email](/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-account/update-your-email) or completely [Delete your account](/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-account/delete-your-account) through [Workspace settings](/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-account/workspace-settings).

Your Streamlit Community Cloud account is identified by your email. When you sign in to Community Cloud, regardless of which method you use, you are providing Community Cloud with your email address. In particular, when you sign in to Community Cloud using GitHub, you are using the primary email on your GitHub account. You can view your email identity and source-control identity from your workspace settings, under "[**Linked accounts**](/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-account/workspace-settings#linked-accounts)."

1. In the upper-left corner, click on your workspace name.
1. In the drop-down menu, click "**Settings**."
