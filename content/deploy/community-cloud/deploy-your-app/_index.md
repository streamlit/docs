# Deploy your app

Streamlit Community Cloud lets you deploy your apps in just one click, and most apps will deploy in only a few minutes. If you don't have an app ready to deploy, fork or clone one from our <a href="https://streamlit.io/gallery" target="_blank">App gallery</a> â€” you can find apps for machine learning, data visualization, data exploration, A/B testing and more. You can also fork and [Deploy from a template](/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/deploy-from-a-template). Once you've deployed your app, check out how you can [Edit your app with GitHub Codespaces](/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app/edit-your-app#edit-your-app-with-github-codespaces).

<Note>

If you want to deploy your app on a different cloud service, check out the [Deploy Streamlit apps](/deploy/tutorials) article in our Knowledge Base.
