# Get started with Streamlit Community Cloud

Welcome to Streamlit Community Cloud, where you can share your Streamlit apps with the world! Whether you've already created your first Streamlit app or you're just getting started, you're in the right place.

First things first, you need to create your Streamlit Community Cloud account to start deploying apps.

    <Tile
        icon="rocket_launch"
        title="Quickstart"
        text="Create your account and deploy an example app as fast as possible. Jump right into coding with GitHub Codespaces."
        link="/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/quickstart"
        background="lightBlue-70"
    />
    <Tile
        icon="security"
        title="Trust and Security"
        text="Security first! If you want to read up on how we handle your data before you get started, we've got you covered."

    />
</TileContainer>

If you're looking for help to build your first Streamlit app, read our [Get started](/get-started) docs for the Streamlit library. If you want to fork an app and start with an example, check out our <a href="https://streamlit.io/gallery" target="_blank">App gallery</a>. Either way, it only takes a few minutes to create your first app.

If you're looking for more detailed instructions than the quickstart, try the following:
