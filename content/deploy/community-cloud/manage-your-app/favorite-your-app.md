# Favorite your app

Streamlit Community Cloud supports a "favorite" feature that lets you quickly access your apps from your workspace. Favorited apps appear at the top of their workspace with a yellow star (<i style={{ verticalAlign: "-.25em", color: "#faca2b" }} className={{ class: "material-icons-sharp" }}>star</i>) beside them. You can favorite and unfavorite apps in any workspace to which you have access as a developer or invited viewer.

<Note>

Favorites are specific to your account. Other members of your workspace cannot see which apps you have favorited.

## Favoriting and unfavoriting your app

You can favorite your app:

- [From your workspace](#favorite-your-app-from-your-workspace).
- [From your app](#favorite-your-app-from-your-app-toolbar)!

### Favorite your app from your workspace

1. From your workspace at <a href="https://share.streamlit.io" target="_blank">share.streamlit.io</a>, hover over your app.

   If your app is not yet favorited, a star outline (<i style={{ verticalAlign: "-.25em" }} className={{ class: "material-icons-sharp" }}>star_border</i>) will appear on hover.

1. Click on the star (<i style={{ verticalAlign: "-.25em" }} className={{ class: "material-icons-sharp" }}>star_border</i>/<i style={{ verticalAlign: "-.25em", color: "#faca2b" }} className={{ class: "material-icons-sharp" }}>star</i>) next to your app name to toggle its favorited status.

### Favorite your app from your app toolbar

From your app at `<your-custom-subdomain>.streamlit.app`, click the star (<i style={{ verticalAlign: "-.25em" }} className={{ class: "material-icons-sharp" }}>star_border</i>/<i style={{ verticalAlign: "-.25em", color: "#faca2b" }} className={{ class: "material-icons-sharp" }}>star</i>) in the upper-right corner to toggle your app's favorited status.
