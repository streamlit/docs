# App settings

This page is about your app settings on Streamlit Community Cloud. From your app settings you can [view or change your app's URL](/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app/app-settings#view-or-change-your-apps-url), manage [public or private access to your app](/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/share-your-app), and update your saved [secrets for your apps](/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/deploy-your-app/secrets-management).

If you access "**Settings**" from your [app chrome](/develop/concepts/architecture/app-chrome) in the upper-right corner of your running app, you can access features to control the appearance of your app while it's running.

## Access your app settings
